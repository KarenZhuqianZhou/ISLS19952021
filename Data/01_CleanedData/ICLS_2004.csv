In the RoBallet environment children choreograph dance movements while wearing sensors and wireless microcontroller boards as well as having more sensors and devices in the environment. The children build robots, and program them, animations, light, and music they compose to respond to their movements. We have a few primary goals in this endeavor; to open new areas for exploration, to use technology to augment expression, and to open creative and expressive uses of technology, mathematics and science to children who may otherwise have no interest. We describe a workshop we ran in conjunction with the National Dance Institute, discuss what we learned, and present our ideas for future development.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:51Z (GMT).

The youth worked in an age and grade integrated, inter-disciplinary, open, learner-centered, project-based way, investigating areas of their own choice, learning through design and construction. We found many results that far exceeded expectations and past performance. We analyze the factors behind these results to shed light on learning environments in general.

Using log-in frequency counts and postings as the basis of analysis, together with interviews revealing the views of community members on lurkers, this study aims to clarify the perception of the lurkers and their lurking trajectories. The findings of this study reveal a tendency toward intentional learning on the part of the lurkers. Given the opportunities to observe other groups engaged in similar tasks and going through similar procedures of inquiry activity in the online community, these lurkers were attracted to the discussion and, through unintentional learning, benefited their respective groups. From a participation framework perspective, the high online frequencies do contribute to group cohesiveness. Lurking contexts in relation to the dimensions of observational learning are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This longitudinal study followed two students who were active student participants in a design intervention that promoted disciplinary engagement in science and history through the following school year.

The decision whether to contribute knowledge to such a database or to withhold it represents a public-goods dilemma. Each group member saves time and energy if s/he only uses the database to get information but does not contribute any information. But if all do so, the database is empty, and nobody has any benefit of it. An experimental environment enabling the study of this dilemma is described, and an overview of five experiments is given. They investigate the effect of the following factors: providing metaknowledge about the importance of the information, providing a bonus system to reward contributing, reducing costs for contribution, establishing prescriptive rules for the number of contributions, and providing feedback about the teammates' contribution behavior.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:53Z (GMT).

This paper describes the design-based research strategy by which we are currently extending an educational MUVE environment and curriculum developed with prior NSF funding.

As a part of a national initiative, Papua New Guinea is engaged in implementing educational reforms that attempt to create strong links between activities in school and students' out-of-school lives. We show how reforms have mitigated some of the sharp discontinuities between activities in and out of school though at the same time they have created others. For example, the prior colonial-like system of education that did not allow use of indigenous languages in school classrooms (a discontinuity between in and out of school) has given way to elementary schools in which children are not only encouraged to use their native language in school, they are taught the indigenous mathematics of traditional life. However, in the process of incorporating the traditional mathematics into school instruction, that mathematics is altered in some fundamental ways, as teachers create explicit links to the base 10 English counting system. The transformations of out-of-school practices raise questions about the long-term impact of schooling on out-of-school mathematical practices and traditional ways.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:55Z (GMT).

In a world of infinite possibilities, it is impossible to predict what type of individual spin a teacher may put on the implementation of the curriculum when they adapt it to their specific needs. This paper, therefore, asserts the importance of identifying the key or pivotal elements of the curriculum in order to assure that they are, at the very least, included in the individualized enactments outside of our control. This planfulness may increase the likelihood of a closer-to-fidelity enactment insuring both student and teacher a richer experience that includes the primary principals the curriculum designers had in mind.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:55Z (GMT).

This empirical exploration of the relationship between descriptions of experimental practice and the learning they support utilizes two concurrent sixth grade design experiments. Each design experiment was based on a practice theory of instruction stemming from one of two divergent descriptions of experimentation. One view of experimentation emphasizes the logic of controlling variables, whereas an alternative description locates instructional leverage in precisely those aspects of experimentation necessarily backgrounded by a focus on logic, that is, in the mundane actions of constructing experimental apparatus. Learning outcomes documented through multiple assessments identify ways in which divergent descriptions of practice support learning in different ways. The results suggest that logic may not play the role often assumed in learning to experiment and point to apparatus construction as an activity from which students glean some flexible capabilities that may be educationally fundamental to experimentation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:55Z (GMT).

In an ethnographic study of professional choreographers and dancers composing in their studios, I sought to understand choreography as a case of distributed cognition, embodied knowledge, and creative work. In this paper, I present a model of the interactions between choreographer and dancers as a system of activity. I explain the specific contributions of each of these roles to the function of the system, and how both individual and joint cognitive activity help to move a composition from initial conception to final performance. I argue that the creative relationship between choreographer and dancers represents a unique model of collective learning, one that is not addressed in current research on cognition in practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:55Z (GMT).

All four, however, share related theoretical perspectives, common videographic data collection and analysis methods for studying the nature of learning, and an emphasis on analyzing dialogic and gestural communication. They all work, too, with populations that are typically excluded from advancement in academic pursuits. Their research settings span elementary and middle school classrooms, after school settings, and museums. Their common goal is to move beyond mere description of learning in varied contexts, towards abstracting features common to all four research agendas, in order to discuss how these common features impact academic access for diverse populations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:56Z (GMT).

We examine the effects of a multifaceted scaling reform which focuses on supporting standards based science teaching in urban middle schools. The effort was one component of systemic reform efforts in Detroit Public Schools. Two cohorts of students that participated in reform curricula are compared with the remainder of the district population, using results from the high-stakes state standardized test in science. Both the initial and scaled up cohorts show substantive increases in science content understanding and process skills over their peers, and significantly higher ""pass rates"" on the statewide assessment up to a year and a half after exposure, with little fall off in achievement gains with increased scale. Examination of results by gender reveals that the curriculum reform effort succeeds in reducing the ""gender gap"" in achievement experienced by urban African-American boys. These findings are an encouraging example of how standards-based urban systemic reform can successfully impact student achievement as measured by statewide standardized instruments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:56Z (GMT).

Developing such understanding is a prerequisite for promoting collaboration in an informed way. Different methodological approaches have been adopted for analyzing collaborative processes in technology-supported settings. As no single method is sufficient to unravel all aspects of a collaborative process, researchers must choose approaches that allow them to gain data on those aspects that are of focal interest for a given research question. This symposium will highlight aspects of the diversity of methodological approaches. The speakers of the symposium will describe the process analyses conducted as part of their research in different content domains and collaborative settings. They will discuss merits and shortcomings of these methods in revealing particular aspects of the collaborative processes. The discussion will compare and contrast the different methodological approaches, working towards the development of a ""methodological toolbox"" which could support informed choice of the appropriate methods of analysis.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:57Z (GMT).

This paper reviews the academic origins of a methodology for developing training applications that incorporate branching storylines to engage users in a first-person learn-by-doing experience, originally referred to as Outcome- Driven Simulations. Innovations and modifications to this methodology from the commercial sector are then reviewed, and the steps in this methodology are described, as implemented in current best practices. Finally, new research efforts based on this methodology are examined, including the introduction of natural language processing technology to enable human- computer conversations and the integration of branching storylines into real-time virtual reality environments. A prototype application to support leadership development within the U.S. Army that includes these advances is described.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:57Z (GMT).

This paper focuses on the case of one youth, Cari and her story, the ""AFYT Groupie"". An in depth, narrative analysis of her story reveals how the oppositional identity Cari has constructed for herself over time is incorporated into the public performance of her story; at the same time her story becomes more generic as the most reportable events of her life are left out. As a result, Cari constructs a new strong oppositional identity that allows her to reassert her positive identity claim as anti-establishment.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:58Z (GMT).

We apply this methodology to examine the interaction and tool use of two groups of pre-service teachers who participated in an online video case analysis activity using STEP system a collaborative environment designed to guide students through online problem-based learning tasks. The goal of the activity for both groups was to collaboratively analyze the video case and then individually apply learning sciences concepts to a lesson design. To examine how tools shape the activity, while the activity shapes collaboration and discourse during the task, we employed chronological representations of discourse and tool-related activity (CORDTRA) to compare learning processes in two groups.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:58Z (GMT).

The tension represents an ideological dilemma (Billig, Condor, Edwards, Gane, Middleton, &amp; Radley, 1988) in education. In our focus on the dilemmatic nature of teaching and learning, this paper illustrates how teachers improvise a balance between organizing K-1 students' science learning through transmission and discovery through their use of discourse strategies and instructional approaches.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:58Z (GMT).

Our proposed approach draws chiefly upon the literature and methodology of Conversation Analysis (CA). Conversation Analysis developed out of and shares the thematic interests of the broader field of inquiry known as Ethnomethodology (EM). EM is centrally concerned with practical reasoning and the procedures (i.e., ""methods"") participants (i.e., ""members"") employ in making sense of their own actions and the actions of others, that is in creating ""local rationality."" CA focuses specifically on the methods members employ in competently producing conversation. Our proposal calls for analogous research into how members engage in instruction and learning. A rigorous methodology has been developed for conducting CA studies and an elaborate and carefully-integrated research literature has been amassed over the years. In some of the foundational writing on EM, Garfinkel proposed a set of policies for EM research. Since we suggest that video analytic research in the learning sciences be conducted using CA methodology and given CA's thematic link to EM studies, we believe that Garfinkel's policies might provide useful guidelines for future research on learning practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:58Z (GMT).

Several graduate students, the first four authors, present and negotiate complementary interpretations of a diagram generated in a computer-simulated stochastic experiment. Individuals use informal visual metaphors, programming, and formal mathematical analysis to ground the diagram, i.e., to achieve a sense of proof, connection, and understanding. The NetLogo modeling-and- simulation environment (Wilensky, 1999) serves to structure the authors' grounding, appropriating, and presenting of a complex mathematical construct. We demonstrate individuals' implicitly diverse explanatory mechanisms for a shared experience. We show that this epistemological diversity, sometimes thought to undermine learning experiences, can, given appropriate learning environments and technological fluency, foster deeper understanding of mathematics and science.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:59Z (GMT).

Many of these efforts involve giving students the opportunity to participate in interesting settings with novel, educationally beneficial roles. Sometimes, these roles can be complex, and students can find themselves without the social skills to participate effectively. When widespread, social deficiencies can interfere with the functioning of a learning environment, and reduce the overall effectiveness of the environment for promoting student learning. While many successful learning community designs have been documented, there is not a lot of literature discussing what to do to strengthen weak implementations. This paper attempts to contribute to the literature by describing the effect of one approach to addressing this kind of problem. It describes the design and outcomes of an intervention to strengthen a sub-optimally functioning learning community by promoting social skill development.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:59Z (GMT).

At the classroom level, among others, these calls emphasize investigations that parallel the nature of scientific work, and advocate the value of peer collaboration. Many existing studies of individual students' scientific reasoning claim that middle-school students do poorly, when asked to explain complex problems and provide evidence in support of their explanations. This study investigates how middle-school students, working in academically homogeneous dyads, investigate an extended, data-rich problem. Findings suggest that middle-school students can collaboratively construct evidence-based explanations, but that they still face important challenges that need further support. Both of these points are discussed in more detail in the paper.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:09:59Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In order to do this, we integrate theories from linguistics, particularly the branch of pragmatics, with work in math education and the learning sciences. Recognizing that communication is an inferential activity, we explore what makes teaching interactions a unique class of communication. Specifically, we suggest that individuals who take on a teaching role must deal with a prediction problem because knowledge is not equally shared between the communicators. Our analysis of classroom observations and tutoring interviews with third grade students learning single digit multiplication elucidate a few of the ways that the prediction problem is addressed in teaching activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:00Z (GMT).

The present study considers whether two teacher practices, modeling explanation and making a framework for explanation explicit to students, predict students' improvement in explanation during a middle-school chemistry unit. Six teachers enacted the unit with a total of 21 classes in urban public schools. We coded the teachers' practices during a focal lesson in which they introduced their students to scientific explanation. Regression analyses showed that teachers' scores for the two practices made unique contributions to the prediction of students' posttest scores for one component of the explanation framework, reasoning (i.e. justification for why evidence supports a claim). Furthermore, charting students' explanations across the unit showed that both teacher practices had an immediate impact on students' reasoning in the focal lesson, relative to the pretest, an effect that carried through the unit. We identify avenues for future research that build on our initial effort at mapping teacher practices to student learning outcomes for explanation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:00Z (GMT).

Text- based experiences are limited and not generally integrated with 1st-hand experiences. We conceptualize inquiry instruction as the interplay of 1st- and 2nd-hand investigations that are text-based. Our study of 2nd-hand investigation utilized texts that are modeled after key elements of the notebook of a scientist. In an experimental study, we investigated the efficacy of four interplay conditions created by counterbalancing type of investigation (1st- or 2nd-hand) and context of investigation (ramp or table) for learning about the role of mass and force on the motion of objects. Participants were 4th grade students from a low SES working-class community. Results of non-parametric statistical tests of pre-post instruction items on a paper- pencil assessment indicated a preferred sequence and mode of investigation of contexts to support learning when 1st- and 2nd-hand investigations are in interplay. We argue that these results suggest it is possible and important to examine learning from instruction at this level of specificity.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:00Z (GMT).

Therefore, we examined the effects of reading decoding abilities and world knowledge (assessed using the WoodcockJohnson III Tests of Achievement) on 61 third-grade readers' comprehension of narrative and expository texts. The children read a narrative (445 words) and an expository (464 words) text. Comprehension of each text was assessed with 12 multiple-choice questions. Comprehension of the narrative text improved as a function of decoding ability. In contrast, expository text comprehension was driven by world knowledge. The latter result indicates that the low-knowledge children were not able to make the knowledge-based inferences required by the expository text, replicating previous work conducted with adult populations (e.g., McNamara, 2001). Potential solutions to facilitate comprehension from expository texts, such as increased text cohesion and reading strategy instruction are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:00Z (GMT).

Most of the information required for this mental mapping is gathered through the visual channel. People who are blind lack this crucial information and in consequence face great difficulties (a) in generating efficient mental maps of spaces, and therefore (b) in navigating proficiently within these spaces. The work reported in this paper follows the assumption that the supply of appropriate spatial information through compensatory sensorial channels, as an alternative to the (impaired) visual channel, may contribute to the anticipatory mental mapping of unknown spaces and consequently, to blind people's spatial performance. The main goals of the study reported in this paper were: (a) The development of a virtual learning environment enabling blind people to learn about real life spaces which they are required to navigate (e.g., school, work place, public buildings); (b) A systematic study of blind people's acquisition of spatial navigation skills by means of the virtual learning environment; (c) A systematic study of the contribution of this anticipatory mapping to blind people's spatial skills and performance in the real environment. In the paper a brief description of the virtual learning environment is presented, as well as findings regarding blind persons' learning process and actual performance in the real space.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:01Z (GMT).

By analyzing the participants' learning processes in the class, it was shown that our program worked well as a learning environment for psychology experiments that included various types of activities such as hypothesis formation, experiment planning, and interpretation of the experimental results. Comparing the results from the pre- and post- tests, we found that the participants learned to be guided, through their learning activities in this environment, to deeper understanding of the research objectives dealt with in the microworld. They also acquired knowledge about research methods, such as experiment designing skills, in order to understand research objectives. These benefits seemed to be brought about by the correspondence of the participants' problem solving activities in the real experiment to the training in the microworld learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:01Z (GMT).

The method utilizes a commentable bulletin board with lecture video clips, which students reflect upon for knowledge integration. Learning from lectures has to be an active process, where learners need to decompose the linear input into components, to identify their roles, select parts important to the topic and to each learner's concern, and to integrate selected parts to form a coherent comprehension. This is comparable to but more demanding than learning from texts because learners have to engage in this decomposition and reconstruction ""on line,"" without records. To make this situation more learnable, we provided sophomore students with a bulletin board on which sequences of 5 to 15 minute clips covering each lecture are placed for comment. Using this support tool, three 90-minute classes were devoted to guiding the students in decomposing and restructuring one of the lectures. Students were required to integrate selected parts of the lecture during this intervention. Sixty-one percent of the students successfully identified the structural connection of one episode at the beginning of the lecture to its main theme, compared to 7% who had succeeded without support prior to such an intervention. Some students commented that this was a new experience for them and gave them a new perspective to take lectures. On a transfer lecture, we found an increase from 5 out of 66 (7.6%) to 26 out of 62 (41%) in the number of students who could give more meaningful comments at the end of the lecture. The results show that the intervention was within reach for the middle-range students, with some potential for the acquired skills to stay on.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:01Z (GMT).

First, the students who studied in pairs built more abstract representations of clinical cases than those working individually. Second, the fact of building a more abstract representation did not lead to higher scores in a transfer task. Third, the students who were trained with examples taken from varied contexts got higher scores in a transfer task than those working with examples from the same context. The partial contradiction between these results questions the relationship between abstraction and transfer. It may also indicate that the abstract representations built as a side-effect of grounding mechanisms were not internalized into personal representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:02Z (GMT).

We examined a teacher's instructional discourse and gesture use during a sixth-grade mathematics lesson that focused on algebraic equations. Informed by prior research in non-educational settings, we hypothesized that the teacher would regularly use gesture to ""ground"" her verbal utterances, and that she would exhibit more gestures for aspects of the lesson content that are more abstract. We found that the teacher frequently used gestures with instructional utterances, and that she used more gesture when discussing abstract concepts and referents. Pointing was the most frequent grounding act overall, and was often used to highlight abstract relations between referents (e.g., the pan balance and the equation). Representational gestures were next most frequent, and often served to provide a familiar ground (such as removing equal objects) for new, abstract ideas (canceling out equal variables). Gesture thus seems to serve as a form of scaffolding. It may also provide insights into teachers' expectations about difficult material as well as their beliefs about student knowledge and conceptual development.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:02Z (GMT).

Specifically, the study investigates the ways in which teachers integrated and extended the key facets of the program two years after its completion with particular emphasis on a) individual teacher characteristics, b) school contextual factors, and c) key components of professional development. The paper focuses on the elements of success in longitudinal technology integration, rather than on the inhibitors to such technology adoption. Therefore, while the investigation draws on case study research of eight teachers, the center of attention remains on the one exemplary teacher who exhibited the maximum characteristics of long-term professional growth. Results indicate that participation in professional development fostered increased technological knowledge and awareness, sustained use of technology integration into classroom instruction, and generation of more elaborate beliefs on the role of technology in teaching and learning. Finally, key findings from this study are incorporated into a framework for articulating teacher generative change.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Here we report on a two year study of learning in a tissue engineering lab, an evolving community of practice in the historically recent field of biomedical engineering. Findings suggest the critical role artifacts play beyond merely being part of a distributed cognitive system. Lab artifacts such as cells and engineered bio-substitutes offer potential cognitive partnerships to learners. Over time, understandings are constructed, revised, enhanced and transformed by learning through and with the artifacts present in the community. We find that these dynamic relationships are critical to knowledge acquisition and deepening forms of participation and in their developed stage, best described as partnerships which support model-based and simulative reasoning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:03Z (GMT).

Goal instructions specify what students should try to achieve during on-line discussions. General goals (to persuade or explore) were crossed with specific goals (to generate reasons or counterarguments/rebuttals) in a 3 x 3 randomized design using 240 undergraduates. The instruction to generate as many reasons as possible resulted in deeper and more qualified arguments, whereas the ""explore"" goal had little effect. The persuade goal resulted in arguments that were more focused and adversarial. These results have important implications for building richer on-line discussions. In particular, instructions to generate as many reasons as possible can result in the exploration and integration of opposing sides of an issue, potentially enhancing psychological understanding and best promoting Mercer's (1996) notion of exploratory talk.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:03Z (GMT).

Based on twelve determinants of knowledge building community (Scardamalia, 2002), we embodied four design frameworks for our design group as a dynamic knowledge building community: (1) learning through participation in authentic problem solving, (2) learning through collaboration, (3) learning by taking collective cognitive responsibility, and (4) learning by explaining. Results of analyses on two students who succeeded in developing pedagogical content knowledge and epistemology manifested that their development was based on the change in authenticity to participate in the practice (from preparation for future teaching work to engagement in the design research) and their concerns with the organizational structure of the design group as a community of practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:03Z (GMT).

We also seek to understand if exposure to the software's detailed scaffolding will result in better performance and learning of targeted skills, and if so, what those differences are. This paper presents results from a study we conducted in Fall 2002 where we sought to enhance the way students in project-based middle school classrooms used second-hand expert cases to reason. This enhancement was in the form of a software tool, the Case Application Suite, that was designed to scaffold students through some of the difficulties involved in applying expert cases. Its design is based on suggestions from the transfer and case-based reasoning literatures and the approach to education called cognitive apprenticeship. We used the Case Application Suite in Learning By DesignTM classrooms where students learn science in the context of addressing interesting design challenges. In this paper, we discuss the design of the software and the study, present and analyze data regarding the software's effectiveness and student performance, and draw some conclusions about the effectiveness of the software and the feasibility of sharing scaffolding responsibilities between teacher, peers, and software.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:04Z (GMT).

An underlying design assumption of project-based curricula is that the goal and role motivate the learning of content, and that learning the content in pursuit of the goal leads to better content understanding. However, research to-date has not explored the extent to which the goal and role actually motivate student participation in practice. The framework we have developed is specifically designed for the analysis of project-based learning environments in that it explicitly considers the influence of student role- and goal- adoption on participation and engagement in project-based activities over time. We believe that this framework, as we continue to refine it, will prove useful for research on participation and engagement in project-based curricula. Specifically, such a framework will help with the identification and design of future lines of research, will facilitate comparison across diverse settings, and will provide a starting point for the integration of the results.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:05Z (GMT).

This paper roughly outlines a pattern-oriented research strategy, aiming to bridge the gap between theory and practice and facilitating improvements in complex social settings like collaborative learning. The ideas underlying this approach are rooted in theory- based evaluation, Realistic Evaluation and explanatory case studies. It is argued for a system- centered view and the role of generative mechanisms as a focal point of inquiry. After an explication of the underlying assumptions a brief description of a pattern-oriented research strategy is presented. Furthermore we discuss strength and weaknesses and propose pattern- oriented research as a reasonable completion to other research strategies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:05Z (GMT).

This study explores the prior knowledge and experiences activated during a project-based science unit in two urban middle school classrooms. A selection of contextualizing lessons was videotaped and stimulated recall interviews were conducted with target students about their thinking during instruction. Interviews were coded for the level of student thinking reported during the interview, the associated contextualizing features, and connections to science concepts, personal experiences, or real world events. Findings suggest that initial contextualizing features such as sharing personal stories and opinions were related to student thinking more about real world events, while features that foster integration such as concept maps and presentations are associated with thinking about both personal events and science together. These findings begin to identify a classification of contextualizing features in terms of the types of student thinking generated during instruction, which can inform the design of materials and professional development to foster and support contextualizing instruction in science classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:05Z (GMT).

Such research identifies how students learn from analogies--but not how students create or use their own analogies. Models of analogy comprehension that have been derived from this research, in particular structure- mapping, cannot be extended to analogy creation. However, features of student-generated analogies show striking similarities to features of categorization, including prototypes, family- resemblance, and a folk-theory basis. In this paper, I present a thread of analogies from a 5th grade science classroom and argue for a view of analogies as a categorization phenomenon.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:06Z (GMT).

Teachers employ an experimental Rules of Thumb practice with more or less fidelity to develop student science talk (defined as the skill or act of communicating and explaining, both in written and/or verbal form, the science concepts and principles within a context in an abstract, generalized form) using scaffolded, iterative instructional practices. Comparison and experimental classrooms completed two post-treatment writing assessments, which were coded and analyzed. This paper presents the results of that analysis and reports that the Rules of Thumb practice may have an effect in developing conceptual understanding, scientific reasoning, and transfer ability and that teacher implementation of the Rules of Thumb practice does indeed affect student outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:06Z (GMT).

However, there is an evident lack of conclusive empirical evidence supporting this claim. Moreover, there are findings indicating that carefully designed one-example conditions may allow for profitable processes of example comparison as well. In line with this reasoning, we present an experiment - that builds up on a series of studies conducted by Quilici and Mayer (1996) yielding that multiple examples are only helpful for schema acquisition if the examples are processed thoroughly and if additional instructional support is provided for learners. Moreover, our study gives first evidence that multiple examples may even impede performance under less optimal learning conditions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:07Z (GMT).

Can learning activities involving Programmable Bricks take place in an economically challenged context? In this paper, we present an attempt to challenge this question by presenting a new framework that turns the acquisition process of Programmable Bricks and its necessary materials into a rich learning process. We present the GoGo Board, a low-cost Programmable Brick that allows the user to actively participate in its production process. We discuss the use of found and broken materials as sources of construction supplies. We analyze two case studies from projects developed in Brazil from 2002 to 2003. Specifically, we discuss the design aspect of the GoGo board framework that allowed for diverse and socially relevant learning projects to take place.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:07Z (GMT).

As a result, educational researchers are sometimes torn between supporting curricular activities that promote complex reasoning and supporting high-stakes tests designed to emphasize facts and conceptual knowledge development over higher-order reasoning. This paper presents results from the first year of a research program to develop and evaluate curricular/assessment systems emphasizing complex reasoning in science.

Forty-nine 11th and 12th grade students learned about ecology and the effects of land use on water quality by collaboratively using the RiverWebSM water quality simulation (WQS) during a two-week curriculum on environmental science. The students' emerging understanding was assessed using pretest and posttest scores. Students' self-regulatory behaviors and teacher's scaffolding of SRL were assessed through an analysis of their discourse during several collaborative problem-solving episodes. Findings indicate that students learned significantly more about ecology after working collaboratively with the WQS. However, these learning gains were quite small and were related to the self-regulatory behaviors observed by the dyads and teacher's scaffolding and instruction. Analyses of video data indicate that a large amount of time was spent by the dyads and teacher in using only a few strategies, while very little time was spent on planning, monitoring, and handling task difficulties and demands. Further analysis revealed that both the dyads and teachers were using low-level strategies (e.g., following procedural tasks, evaluating the content, searching, and selecting informational sources in the WQS) to learn about the topic. Our results provide a valuable initial characterization of the complexity of self- and co-regulated learning in a complex, dynamic, technology-enhanced, student- centered science classroom. We will discuss how the results will be used to inform the design of computers as MetaCognitive tools designed to foster students' learning of conceptually challenging science topics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:09Z (GMT).

Engagement in gameplay was a complex process of appropriation and resistance, recruiting students' identities and intentions. Learning occurred through recursive cycles of failure and revising strategies, which led to frustration, engagement and learning. Students developed familiarity with game concepts and deeper understandings of relationships among history, geography, economics, and politics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:09Z (GMT).

This study examines what learning occurs when an electromagnetism simulation game is used in a school for underserved students. Students in the experimental group performed better than students in the control group (guided discovery-based science) on measures for understanding. Game mechanics enabled students to confront weaknesses in understandings, and physics representations became tools for understanding problems. Implications for the design of educational digital media are discussed. Yet, it was also these very same game mechanics posed significant challenges in terms of student engagement, motivation, and learning of physics concepts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:09Z (GMT).

This paper outlines an ongoing cognitive ethnography of a currently thriving MMOG. Using discourse analytic methods, this project is developing a ""thick description"" (Geertz, 1973) of naturally-occurring gameplay, paying particular attention to the forms of socially and materially distributed cognition that emerge, the learning mechanisms embedded within community practice, and the ways in which participation shapes and is shaped by the situated (on- and off-screen) identities of its members.

Metanavigation support in the form of prompts was provided to groups of students who used a system called CoMPASS to complete a design challenge. The metanavigation prompts aimed at encouraging students to understand the affordances of the navigational aids in CoMPASS and use them to guide their navigation. The results suggested that providing metanavigation support enabled the groups to make coherent transitions among the text units. Findings also revealed that reading comprehension, presence of metanavigation support and prior domain knowledge significantly predicted students' individual understanding of science principles and the relationships among them.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:10Z (GMT).

This report reports the results of a study held in two courses: one in the fall of 2000 (n=19 mentors), and the other in the spring of 2001 (n=10 mentors). We use quantitative data to document improvement trends in mentoring quality, and qualitative data to examine the program's success from the perspective of the prospective teachers. The results indicate that many of the prospective teachers learned to guide students' problem solving with questions and hints and learned about the range and types of solution methods that students use to solve problems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:10Z (GMT).

We show that the communication capabilities and representational infrastructure of handheld computers can support a variety of effective learning activities, ranging from activities that are collaborative to activities that are practice-oriented. Furthermore, we show that eighth grade students who participated in a month-long curriculum using our handheld technologies outperformed high school students on AP Calculus Exam items.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:11Z (GMT).

One way educators can foster this kind of metacognition is to utilize the Socratic Method; ask learners probing questions to get them to examine their own thinking and assist them in an inquiry process. When there are not enough educators skilled in facilitating Socratic dialogue available to help all the learners in a learning environment in a timely manner, we propose using Web-based Socratic tutoring software to assist with the workload. We designed such a system and evaluated its effectiveness. The system, known as Sask, utilizes the Socratic Method via human computer interaction techniques to make the experience feel like a conversation with one's educator. It also includes an authoring system designed to help educators quickly and easily build the tutors, called Mentors. In a quasi-experimental study the Sask system had a statistically significant effect size of 0.69 on students' post-test scores. This implies that the unique interactive design of Sask Mentors can make such Socratic software effective tools for improving a learning environment where human educators already engage students in inquiry dialog.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:11Z (GMT).

The context was an online professional development one credit course with 1:1 mentoring of students. Additionally, student learning goals, beliefs about learning, and levels of trust were examined as factors that may mitigate the effects of social presence. Results indicate that social presence affects the learner's interactions and perception of the mentor but has no effect on perceived learning, satisfaction, engagement, or the quality of their final course product. These findings suggest social presence is a correlational rather than a causal variable associated with student learning. Exploratory analyses suggest no effect of student learning goals, but that trust is associated with performance.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:12Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Yet few studies of organizational learning about globalization systematically address its process at different organizational levels, or ground theories with in-depth empirical data. This paper presents our analysis of data from a longitudinal ethnographic study on organizational learning with regard to globalization. Using contrasting cases, we explore organizational learning in the context of a professional society developing its global strategy. These cases include the organization's interactions with potential partners in four countries. Based on the analysis, we present three claims and their practical implications for organizational learning about globalization.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:12Z (GMT).

For instance, many students learning about scatterplots consistently create representations which have the surface features of scatterplots but with informational content more appropriate for discrete bar graphs. Schwartz and Bransford (1998) have found that combining feature- based conceptual instruction with contrasting cases is an effective way to help students make conceptual distinctions. We adapt their approach to the domain of data representation and incorporate it into a cognitive tutoring curriculum. We show that this new curriculum improves learning more than a curriculum where the contrasts are not present.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:12Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Technology studies provide a sophisticated learning environment in which computers are simultaneously part of the subject matter learned and a means for teaching and learning. In the beginning stages, pupils highly depend on teachers' instructions and help. Pupils working on non-computerized projects in electronics are likely to progress along a conventional path: planning, constructing, troubleshooting and improving. In contrast, pupils working on computer-based projects tend to modify their systems, drift away from the initial design suggested by the teacher, take risks, improvise and make progress through trial and error. Computerized projects impart flexibility, freedom of action and independence to the pupils beyond that usually found at school. Computerized projects encourage cooperation and teamwork among pupils through the Internet. Under ""Internet culture,"" pupils quickly zip between sources of information, download programs from different sources and exchange ideas with friends. New ideas, especially regarding computer programming, are distributed among the pupils, developed and refined, and become common property. Computerized projects encourage pupils to cross the line from fully teacher-guided work and become confident and independent learners.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:35Z (GMT).

Recent reform documents explicitly put forward the idea that all students regardless of culture, gender, race, and/or socioeconomic status, are capable of understanding and doing science. Despite this emphasis, there continue to be widespread differences in the access, retention, and achievement of students depending on their culture, gender, race, and/or socioeconomic status. To address this need, the Urban Ecology Institute in partnership with the Boston Public Schools and the Lynch School of Education at Boston College has been developing and implementing a field- based science program to engage traditionally underrepresented groups in the doing of real- world science. To date we have found that our program improves student interest in science, supports students in developing a better understanding of scientific methodologies, and improves students' sense of environmental stewardship when compared to students experiencing traditional science instruction over the course of an academic year.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:35Z (GMT).

Additionally, it is unclear how conventional ""grand theories"" of interest and motivation fit within contemporary models of educational research that focus more on developing intermediate-level theory in the context of efforts to refine practices. Our symposium features five researchers in the learning sciences community who are studying interest, engagement, and motivation.

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of learners' use of help facilities has been subject to extensive debate. Recent research indicates an inefficient use or even ignorance of help functions. In this paper the issues of effectiveness of help and the impact of learner-related factors are addressed in an ILE for plant identification. We report first explorative data from a regular university course in plant identification. Students worked in a dyadic setting. The effects of two different types of help facilities (context-sensitive help and glossary function) on task performance in plant identification are analyzed. In addition, a broad set of potential learner-related factors is explored with respect to their effects on help-seeking in dyads, including prior knowledge, motivational orientation, interest, self-estimated competence, and epistemological beliefs. Results yield a positive effect of help-seeking on task performance. In addition, most learner-related factors affect help-seeking behavior and performance. The results are discussed with respect to their implications for future research on help-seeking in ILE.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We examined the quality of middle-school students' self-explanations of a science text which were collected while they were engaged with iSTART, an interactive computer program that teaches reading strategies. Our analysis included an examination of how the quality of paraphrases (i.e., restating the sentence) and elaborations (i.e., drawing on prior knowledge) were mediated by individual difference measures (reading comprehension skill and prior science knowledge) and sentence difficulty (based on information density). Reading comprehension skill was an important determinant in the production of paraphrases and elaborations. In addition, reading skill affected the quality of self-explanations produced; that is, skilled readers produced better quality elaborations (e.g., elaborations that helped build a global understanding of the text). Prior knowledge was also important, with high-knowledge students providing more `distant' paraphrases. Finally, the production of elaborations and paraphrases was influenced by sentence difficulty. Fewer accurate elaborations were produced for the more difficult sentences. Implications for individual differences and sentence difficulty in the production of self-explanations are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Traditional approaches to extracting expertise in principals are sufficient to capture some differences in behavior and may hint at cognitive differences, but we argue that they do not tackle differences in the architecture of the problem space that principals construct when they are working on instructional problems. Drawing on a subset of data from a larger study of 40 principals, we present our visual approach to understanding how principals reason through problems. We conclude the paper with a discussion of how our approach could be used to better understand the practice of instructional leadership.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-02-03T04:10:37Z (GMT).
