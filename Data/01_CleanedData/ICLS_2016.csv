The two types of knowledge develop together, but are fostered by different learning tasks. Exploratory tasks enable students to manipulate representations and discover the underlying concepts. Structured tasks let students practice problem-solving procedures step-by-step. Educational technology has mostly relied on providing only either task type, with a majority of learning environments focusing on structured tasks. We investigated in two quasi-experimental studies with 8-10 years old students from UK (N = 121) and 10-12 years old students from Germany (N = 151) whether a combination of both task types fosters robust knowledge more than structured tasks alone. Results confirmed this hypothesis and indicate that students learning with a combination of tasks gained more conceptual knowledge and equal procedural knowledge compared to students learning with structured tasks only. The results illustrate the efficacy of combining both task types for fostering robust fractions knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:38Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Practitioners and researchers have well recognized the critical role of the pre-class learning on students’ performance in the flipped class. However, little research has investigated how students learn in the pre-class setting and what factors can help students improve their pre-class learning. Based upon the self-regulated learning theory, this study used both survey research and learning analytics methods to uncover students’ performance trajectories of a semester in two flipped undergraduate math courses and examined whether the three key self-regulated learning factors – self-efficacy, the use of metacognitive strategy, and self-regulatory behaviors – were significantly different across different performance trajectories. The results revealed six different performance trajectories among students and found significant differences across these trajectories in terms of the three self-regulatory factors.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:39Z (GMT).

But mastering the “what”, “why” and “how” of the cultural tools that science employs, and appropriating the structures and systems designed to enculturate them into communities of inquiry is no easy feat. Taking a practice perspective on IBL can illuminate some challenges that teachers, students and educational designers encounter, and may help researchers operationalize important variables, capturing the complexity of this learning practice. A new definition of IBL will be unpacked showing the added value of regarding it as a practice. This will inform first and foremost the pedagogical design approach, but will also hold implications for methods of research. The feasibility of the ambition to enculturate learners into an authentic practice, providing them with transferrable skills, will be discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:40Z (GMT).

These extended beyond control of variables to include attribution and prediction in coordination of multiple variables affecting an outcome, as well as argument and counterargument in advancing and challenging claims.  Social science content was used to help students see the purpose and value of scientific practices. The objective was largely met, as evidenced by two 6th grade classes (n = 49), both outperforming a control group (n = 23). Although students engaged successfully in argument and counterargument, less successful was meta-level reasoning about argumentation and nature of science. Importantly in its practical implications, one intervention group showed less gain in 10 45-min whole-class sessions than did the other group who engaged as pairs in the same sequence of activities over an average of six 24-min individualized sessions, suggesting the greater efficacy of individualized engagement.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:41Z (GMT).

By using Social Network Analysis with chosen keywords and analyzing quality of notes, we are able to identify and trace the evolvement of ideas that become promising talking points within the discourse space. Findings show that ideas can be classified and further analyzed to have an impact on subsequent discourse. Teachers can focus their resources on promising ideas that help the community maintain engagement in creative work to improve ideas, so as to learn more effectively and attain knowledge creation goals.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:42Z (GMT).

We taught learners to solve problems using worked example and practice problem pairs with one of three kinds of instructional design that either did not highlight the subgoals, described the subgoals, or prompted participants to describe the subgoals for themselves. In addition, we varied the distance of transfer between the worked example and practice problem pairs. We found that instructions that highlighted subgoals improved performance on later problem solving tasks. The groups that performed best were those that received subgoal descriptions with farther transfer between examples and practice problems and those that described subgoals for themselves with nearer transfer.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:42Z (GMT).

In this study, we propose and validate a model of adaptive expertise needed for teachers to successfully deliver NGSS-informed computer supported complex systems curricula in high school science classrooms. The model is comprised of three research-based qualities that we hypothesize teachers need to demonstrate: flexibility, deeper level understanding, and deliberate practice, in adapting interventions to their particular teaching contexts. We apply the model to understand whether it can, a) show variation between teachers, and b) predict student-learning outcomes. Results show that teacher enactments and interview responses assessed on the model reveal sufficient variation, and are also predictive of students’ growth in complex systems understanding. The model has important implications for how to support teachers in adopting new science education reforms.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, it is difficult to adapt one’s teaching practices without first noticing the key features of classroom activity. This kind of noticing—professional vision—is   a cultivated skill that requires a combination of understanding theory and experience with practice. When theory-practice connections are not strong, teachers tend to fall back on “what works.” Demands to support pre-service teachers in developing stronger theory-practice connections are increasing, yet this remains a challenging goal. The qualitative analysis presented in this paper offers insight into how creation of multimedia artifacts can support pre-service teachers in connecting theory to practice while developing their professional vision. Findings suggest the process of creating and collaboratively refining multimedia artifacts in small groups improves pre-service teachers’ ability to make theory-practice connections and provides opportunity for them to exercise their emerging professional vision.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:44Z (GMT).

Building on Vygotsky’s methodological insights on unit analysis, I elaborate on an approach that studies reflection as a collective, social and material phenomenon. I define the joint production of accounts of prior experiences as the unit of social interaction that contains all the essential features of anything that can be ascribed to reflection as a cognitive process. Drawing from empirical (interaction) analyses conducted as part of a larger multi-data project on debriefing and retrospective situations, I describe constitutive features of reflection as collective practice. I show how this kind of analysis contributes to an explanation of reflection as learning process in its own right, and not just as a factor that “affects” learning. I conclude discussing theoretical and practical implications.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:45Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Because p-prims are a class of knowledge elements developed and abstracted from everyday physical experiences, it seems plausible that immediate physical experiences, both in terms of sensations and actual observations of motion, would cue knowledge in different ways than when those experiences are just discussed as hypotheticals. This paper presents two cases to show that immediate embodied experiences with everyday objects does change which p-prims are cued and how they are deployed by students to explain situations involving motion. These cases come from a corpus of videorecorded interviews with high school students who were asked to explain predicted and enacted motions that involved deliberate sensory engagement with their bodies. Findings suggest that a connection is indeed present, and learners’ embodied experiences should be leveraged in future work to support conceptual change in science.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:47Z (GMT).

It describes a case study of eight elementary school teachers working on lesson design using knowledge building pedagogy to enhance student learning. The research question is: “How is knowledge building accomplished among teachers within a PLC?” The main method employed is the analysis of teacher’s discourse in the PLC. Results indicate that although not cognisant of it, these teachers functioned as a reciprocal layer of knowledge builders over their students’ work. Critically, teachers’ knowledge building was enabled by working with authentic classroom problems, embracing idea diversity and demonstrating epistemic agency in their knowledge advancement. Future work can focus on building teacher’s awareness of this layer of knowledge building and scripting creation of knowledge artefacts among teachers to mediate and record their collaborative inquiry.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:48Z (GMT).

One context where students seem to persist is gameplay. This paper investigates whether an educational computer programming game can enhance student persistence and learning. Students were assigned to play either the Full version of a game, or a Minimal version of the game that ablated several common game features. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found that students who played the Full Game persisted less at challenging tasks, wrote less challenging code during gameplay, and were less willing to learn more about coding in the future. Ultimately, players of the Full Game also learned less than students who played the Minimal Game. Results suggest that certain design features of educational games can negatively impact a player’s approach to challenging learning tasks, which in turn can negatively impact learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:49Z (GMT).

Selecting information, and evaluating and integrating claims from potentially competing documents is a complex literacy task. Prior research exploring differing behaviours and their association to constructs such as epistemic cognition has used ‘multiple document processing’ (MDP) tasks. Using this model, 270 paired participants, wrote a review of a document. Reports were assessed using a rubric associated with features of complex literacy behaviours. This paper focuses on the conceptual and empirical associations between those rubric-marks and textual features of the reports on a set of natural language processing (NLP) indicators. Findings indicate the potential of NLP indicators for providing feedback regarding the writing of such outputs, demonstrating clear relationships both across rubric facets and between rubric facets and specific NLP indicators.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:49Z (GMT).

We compared three visualizations: 1) hand gestures with a pointer, 2) gaze overlay, and 3) no-augmentation baseline. We investigate the teacher-student pair in a video-based learning context as an abstraction of an expert-novice pair where the goal is to attain a high level of shared understanding. The key phase of having a shared understanding is to have a common ground between the pair. Previous studies showed that explicit deixis plays a major role in initiating and maintaining common ground. This led us to hypothesize that augmenting videos with teacher’s deictic gestures might help students perform better. We found that augmenting the video with teacher’s gaze results in higher learning gain than no visualization. Moreover, gaze visualization also helped students in maintaining longer attention spans than hand gestures.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Our analysis of 99 student team responses to three embedded assessments generated formative evidence that delineated three tiers of explainers (non-mechanistic, partial mechanistic, and mechanistic). These students differed in their knowledge and abilities to perform these interrelated STEM practices.

We engaged thirteen community college instructors in iterative design through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to design and develop new developmental mathematics lessons. In this study, as in most design-partnerships, teachers touch only some aspects of the design process. In the work reported here, we make explicit the varying ways in which instructors took part in PDSA cycles and examine the types of knowledge generated by their participation. We use Edelson (2002) as a lens to categorize learning into three types: domain, design framework, and design methodology. Results indicate that instructors do not need to be involved in every aspect of design to learn. Our findings highlight the role time plays on engagement and learning in design. Implications for design efforts, to the extent they are focused on learning, are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:51Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Despite its significance for group work, we know relatively little about how identities play a dual role when students collaborate. The aim of this paper is to explore this process through multiple case studies: we aim to explore how identities are enacted and used in making personal sense and understand the content knowledge, while at the same time we are interested in how this process can take a form of renewing process in the sense that the identities enacted are themselves changed, transformed or re-negotiated. Our results show that due to its dual role, identities mediate collaborative learning not only because knowledge is constructed in relation to identities but because online selves are articulated and constructed in relation to knowledge construction.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:52Z (GMT).

In order to design a technology-enhanced course in engineering estimation, we conducted a study of experienced engineers working on estimation problems. A three-phase process for engineering estimation, and the cognitive mechanisms underlying them, emerged from the analysis of this data. We highlight the roles of mental simulation and external representation in the estimation process.

Our research focuses on understanding relationships and pathways within and across “hubs” emerging in the neighborhood that lead to authentic and meaningful change. This paper presents our current analytic attention to the boundaries, pathways and spaces between hubs. Adopting the metaphor of “doing Double Dutch” emerging from team analysis, we develop the themes of “pathways in” as opening doors; “pathways through” as feeling the rhythms; and the learning and dexterity that energizes trajectories beyond the hubs in the neighborhood. We propose the constructs of rhythm, attunement and dexterity as conceptual and analytic tools to inform our understandings of pathways and boundaries as “hidden energies” for community development and their generative potential for learning. We conclude that stagnation is not an option.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:53Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Adopting a phenomenographical approach, we examine the narratives of 2 teacher participants documented in pre- and post- lesson conferences, classroom enactments and interviews, so as to tease out variations in the ways they experienced and mediated the paradoxical tensions. Based on the findings of these tensions, a pedagogical paradoxes framework is presented, illustrating the interplay between the different dimensions of the paradoxes. By surfacing these paradoxes, we hope to draw awareness to the challenges and reconciliation in the decision-making and rationalisation process that teachers as learning designers may experience. A heightened awareness can enable teachers to consciously negotiate the paradoxes in designing different kinds of learning experiences better tailored for their students.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:54Z (GMT).

However, self-regulated online learning is not done in isolation and inherently social. Group awareness research suggests that socio-cognitive information may be a strong asset to collaborative and individual learning. Integrating individual research traditions into a social setting, our experimental study (N = 61) investigates how visualizing socio-cognitive information influences core individual learning processes, especially the search for information, the learners’ self-evaluations of knowledge and learning outcomes. While on the surface study behaviour seemed not to be affected by the availability of socio-cognitive information, more profound analyses revealed that learners provided with partner information did rely less heavily on initial self-evaluations, but adapted their evaluations and focused more on the partner information provided. Knowledge gain was not affected. In conclusion, social context can be an important factor in self-regulation emphasizing that individual and collaborative research traditions may complement each other.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:55Z (GMT).

In this paper, we argue for focusing on the development of disciplined interpretation as an epistemic and representational practice that progressively deepens students’ computational modeling in science by valuing, rather than deemphasizing, the subjective nature of the experience of modeling. We report results from a study in which fourth grade children engaged in computational modeling throughout the academic year. We present three salient themes that characterize the development of students’ disciplined interpretations in terms of their development of computational modeling as a way of seeing and doing science.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:56Z (GMT).

We must provide teachers with the appropriate support to navigate this change. The first step in supporting teachers to help students learn science practices is understanding current approaches for teaching science practices. We investigated the question: How do teachers support science practices in their classrooms? We analyzed how two teachers supported students by engaging and guiding students to participate in science practices; we focused on two key science practices: constructing and defending scientific explanations and analyzing and interpreting data. We found that teachers most frequently engaged students in practices but did not necessarily provide guidance for how to participate, explain why science practices are important, or describe how all the practices are connected. Teachers may need additional guidance to develop concrete teaching strategies to support science practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:57Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, supporting students in engaging meaningfully in scientific practices is challenging because we do not know much about what students learn about the process of engaging in scientific practices, or the epistemic criteria guiding their work. In this paper, I characterize how classroom communities develop sets of epistemic heuristics by engaging in scientific practices over time. Specifically, I present how one classroom community’s implicit answers to “What kind of answer are we working to build?” and to “How does the idea we are trying to build relate to other phenomena and ideas?” shifted throughout a unit. I argue that these shifts were designed into the curriculum, but required strategic work on the teacher’s part; and that these shifts reflect epistemic learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:57Z (GMT).

This paper uses a case study of the Creative Computing Online Workshop—a large-scale online learning experience for teachers—to explore the variety and breadth of teacher learning outcomes that can be considered meaningful. Through in-depth interviews with teacher participants we find that teachers make use of their learning in four distinct, but related, ways: engagement with new ideas, varied enactment in practice, rethinking of role and identity, and changing interaction with the world outside their classroom. We conclude by considering the implications of this expanded framework of teacher learning for future design and evaluation of professional development.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:29:59Z (GMT).

Collaborative learning may be beneficial to include in ITSs, particularly for conceptual knowledge. There is little work on collaborative ITSs, and it has mostly focused on older students. We aim to extend this work to elementary school students, by extending an ITS for fractions so it supports collaborative learning. We also build upon our previous work to further investigate the complementary strengths of collaborative and individual learning. In our study, 189 elementary school students worked with a conceptual or a procedural fractions ITS, and either individually or collaboratively. Students in both ITS conditions learned, but there were no differences in learning between individual and collaboration. However, the students working collaboratively spent less time on the tutor, indicating potential benefits of collaborative learning on efficiency in this setting.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:00Z (GMT).

In the program, students self-selected roles (e.g., writers, scientists, artists, and engineers) and worked in small groups to create multimedia science fictions. In order to understand the high integration level between science and writing in one focus group’s final product, this study examines students’ collaborative learning processes, the characteristics of their interactions, and their role-changing patterns. We found that the high integration level between science and writing may be explained by (a) the interactions between the writer and the scientist during discussion and multimodal composing, and (b) the catalyst role of the artist in the group discussion.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:00Z (GMT).

Using these four methods to analyze the discourse of a pair of students programming, we identified numerous examples of positioning shifts, and see how inequities could potentially emerge through discursive mechanisms. We then reflect on what each of these four different methods foreground, their strengths and shortcomings, including their sensitivity to time-scope and pedagogy, and triangulate the quantified and qualitative results.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:03Z (GMT).

All children explained without materials for the 1st and 3rd explanation. For the 2nd explanation, children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions to use: physical objects; a number line; or no materials (control condition) to explain their thinking. Findings showed how using physical objects significantly influenced the particular types of gestures (e.g. splitting), hand morphology (e.g. pinching), and words (e.g. “take”, “big”) that children used in subsequent explanations without materials. Similar (although less pronounced) priming effects were found for the number line condition. The study provides support for conceptual metaphor theory (used to categorize gestures and language), and the potential for gesture research to address long-standing questions concerning the role of concrete materials in learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:04Z (GMT).

The proposed extension focuses on different contexts in the sense of groups’ and individuals’ different interpretations of the same student-generated artifact. A classroom of 9th grade earth science students created embodied models for a specific scientific concept, the steady state energy of the earth. We describes that the students encountered difficulties aligning their embodied models with their conceptual understandings, and yet, they were able to make progress by changing their models to better align their understanding of the scientific concept with their newly modified model—instances of individual and group learning. We conclude with discussing implications for designing classrooms learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:04Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Specifically we compare the affordances of annotation of a fictional essay to knowledge integration guidance on revision of science writing. 293 middle-school students were randomly assigned to condition. Students who annotated an essay made significantly greater pre to post test gains and were also better able to use automated guidance on a posttest item than students who only received knowledge integration guidance.

These responses, which can be regarded as instructional “resources” that have potential value for facilitating students’ deep learning, are not fully used in teachers’ everyday practice. By proposing the notion of “student-generated resources” (SGRs) and adopting a “resources use” rather than sociolinguistic perspective, this study investigates what SGRs are there in the classroom and how teachers process them. Based on classroom observations, we identify five types of SGRs. Following the “perceive–interpret–mobilize” processing flow, teachers demonstrate three processing results (utilize, feedback, and abandon). Further, we identify three approaches of teachers’ utilization of SGRs and five approaches of their feedback to SGRs. Our findings suggest that teachers tend to give feedback to SGRs rather than utilize them as resources. This study broadens theoretical landscape about classroom resources and helps teachers take full advantage of SGRs in empowering students’ learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:06Z (GMT).

Are there patterns in the pivotal moments when emerging understanding turns for the better or worse? While components such as modeling software, delayed instruction methods such as productive failure, and analogical-encoding methods such as contrasting cases have all been shown effective at supporting deep learning in science, little is known about the micro-level mechanisms explaining how and why students might be more or less successful when working in an environment combining all three. This paper details our refinements of an innovative method for unpacking the micro-level mechanisms contributing to turning points in the successes and failures in collaborative understanding when learning science with computer modeling. In unpacking our methodology, we discuss work including Sanderson and Fisher’s (1994) exploratory sequential data analysis (ESDA) guidelines and the productive multivocality project (Suthers, 2013) to frame our approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:06Z (GMT).

We compare two approaches: a traditional psychometric approach, which models the global correlation structure of student discourse markers across the learning intervention, and a model that accounts for the local correlation structure of discourse markers within activities. We investigate whether: (a) analysis of local correlation structure can identify significant differences between novices and relative experts; (b) these differences reflect meaningful differences the discourse; and (c) analysis of global correlation structure can identify significant differences between novices and relative experts. We assess whether an approach that models local relationships among concepts in a domain provides useful information beyond what might be extracted from a more traditional modeling approach. Our results indicate that techniques that account for local correlation structure can identify patterns in discourse not reflected in global correlation structure.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:08Z (GMT).

While visualization is increasingly looked to as a key means of understanding learning, there are few tools at learning scientists’ disposal that are simultaneously scalable yet also aligned with sociocultural perspectives. Situated Action Networks attempt to address this by appropriating techniques from social network analysis while aligning them with Cultural Historical Activity Theory. They accomplish this by (1) elevating learning activities to the forefront of learning visualizations, allowing for rich qualitative analyses of learning and (2) creating theoretically aligned indices that afford quantitative analyses within and across learning environments. Using data on collaborative learning dynamics between informal learning organizations as they engage in joint projects, we show the affordances of this method for understanding learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:09Z (GMT).

Using ethnographic and longitudinal data, we focus on two young women of color as they negotiated and maintained STEM-related identities in the discursive and practice contexts of their lives at school. Using Holland and Lave’s concept of history-in-person (2001), we view the young women as fighting for particular versions of a future self, while entangled in discursive and social relations that threatened to position them differently than they wished to be. Our findings suggest a need for an explicit naming and examination of the “double bind” that young women of color experience as they move through school environments and special support to prepare them for the challenges they may face in STEM-related college programs or workplaces.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:10Z (GMT).

We further use the notion of keys (Goffman, 1974) to examine how the students construct distinct participation frameworks (Goodwin, 1993) within the two activity designs, and how this organization of activity may impact their learning experience. Our analyses show that students within a game-play environment were more oriented towards accomplishing a goal rather than understanding how a system works whereas those in the modeling-play group focused more explicitly on understanding mechanism and process.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:10Z (GMT).

These tools provide learners with visualizations of relevant cognitive information on their learning partners, triggering the resolution of cognitive conflicts, improving accurate partner modeling and, associated therewith, implicitly guiding learners’ activities instead of prescribing certain ways of behaving. Said visualizations can be differentiated by the type of awareness information they provide: qualitative or quantitative. We systematically compared the impact of both types of information on collaborative learning in an experimental study (N = 51). The results suggest that the availability of both qualitative and quantitative information can evoke cognitive conflicts that guide learners’ communication behavior in a goal-oriented way. Furthermore, visualizations combining both types of information appear to facilitate accurate partner modeling.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:11Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Data gathered in task-based semi-structured clinical interviews included action logging, eye-gaze tracking, and videography. Successful task performance coincided with spontaneous appearance of stable dynamical gaze-path patterns soon followed by multimodal articulation of strategy. Significantly, gaze patterns included uncued non-salient screen locations. We present cumulative results to argue that these ‘attentional anchors’ mediated participants’ problem solving. We interpret the findings as enabling us to revisit, support, refine, and elaborate on central claims of Piaget’s theory of genetic epistemology and in particular his insistence on the role of situated motor-action coordination in the process of reflective abstraction.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:12Z (GMT).

Fundamentally, epistemic learning is proposed because changing classroom practices is more than a surface or shallow change phenomena, but requires teachers to fundamentally shift in perspective or way of seeing how learning is to be practiced. We describe this epistemic learning model and explore its effectiveness. Various types of data were collected, including surveys, interviews, field notes, and teachers’ lesson design artifacts. It is found that the seeded teachers from the five schools, regardless of their own teaching profiles and school contexts, have obtained high degrees of buy-in of the innovation and developed their readiness towards implementation for the future enactments. It is envisioned that such an epistemic learning model will inform the design for teacher professional development, in the pursuit of innovation diffusion, serving a wider community of the teaching practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:12Z (GMT).

Disruptions have largely been a neglected object of theorizing, even though they are acknowledged in models of interest development, such as the four phase model (Hidi & Renninger, 2006). We build upon Azevedo’s (2011, 2013) lines of practice theory by drawing on conceptions of social practice from German-Danish critical psychology to expand and complicate the notion of “conditions of practice” for the youth in our study. We examined youth in our interview study who reported experiencing disruptions to their interest-related pursuits. We found that some youth suspended their participation due to loss of access to necessary resources, and other youth suspended pursuits due to competing educational commitments and future desires.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:13Z (GMT).

Empirical evidence from a qualitative study is presented as we elaborate and further develop this framework. In this study, twenty-six undergraduate students were interviewed to reason about competing arguments on global climate change. In-depth analysis of participants’ interview responses demonstrated important characteristics of the cognitive processes and underpinning mechanisms of scientific reasoning. This work adds to ongoing discussion about the nature of scientific reasoning and provides a holistic approach to characterizing and evaluating scientific reasoning. Furthermore, by capturing important features of individuals’ reasoning when faced with climate issues, this work has significant implications for classroom science teaching and learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:14Z (GMT).

Here we report on moments of productive failure from an eight-week long workshop with 16 high school freshman (13-15 years) who engaged in an open-ended design problem, making an electronic textile. Using students’ self reports, we found that students encountered failure mostly in the design and crafting of circuits, and in these exploration phases students generated a multitude of successful and unsuccessful solutions. Our findings indicate that students’ design artifacts function as a source of within-task feedback supporting their persistence through failures. Additionally, our findings highlight a need for further research examining what Kapur’s consolidation phase looks like in an open-ended design environment, particularly focusing on the development of canonical problems from design activities as a way to have students experience failure and success in constrained design contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:16Z (GMT).

Through classroom observations, structured interviews and learner pre/post tests, the impact of coaching on teacher practices, teacher beliefs and student outcomes were studied and compared with those of teachers who were not coached.

The study examines whether this perceptual compensation creates a comparable learning environment. Students who are blind worked with auditory models; sighted students used visual models. Conceptual understanding and systems reasoning were assessed with pre- and post-test questionnaires. Learning processes were captured by analyzing their workbook writings. The L2C environment not only supported blind students’ learning similarly, but also furthered their learning with one of the more challenging concepts, diffusion. Some concepts relating to the micro-level were learned earlier among the blind students. It seems that auditory representation increases sensitivity to the micro-level interactions in a way less accessible in visual representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:17Z (GMT).

But there is far less work analyzing the diversity of ways that successful groups of students use to achieve visual coordination. The goal of this paper is to illustrate how well-coordinated groups establish and sustain joint visual attention by unpacking their different strategies and behaviors. Our data was collected in a dual eye-tracking setup where dyads of students (N=54) had to interact with a Tangible User Interface (TUI). We selected two groups of students displaying high levels of joint visual attention and compared them using cross-recurrence graphs displaying moments of joint attention from the eye-tracking data, speech data, and by qualitatively analyzing videos generated for that purpose. We found that greater insights can be found by augmenting cross-recurrence graphs with spatial and verbal data, and that high levels of joint visual attention can hide a free-rider effect (Salomon & Globerson, 1989). We conclude by discussing implications for automatically analyzing students’ interactions using dual eye-trackers.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:18Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Explanations for the effectiveness of PF point at the importance of contrasting the student’s solution ideas with critical aspects of the correct solution during instruction. However, other mechanisms of PF have not yet been investigated in detail. Here, we focus on the role of communication patterns during the initial problem-solving phase. Using existing process data from a PF study, we investigated communication patterns based on the ICAP-model and correlated them with prior knowledge, quantity and quality of student solutions, and conceptual knowledge at post-test. Our findings suggest that interactive communication during the initial problem-solving phase only fosters conceptual knowledge if students discuss those ideas that particularly lend themselves to being contrasted with critical aspects of the correct solution during the subsequent instruction phase.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:19Z (GMT).

Some assume that badges should only contain claims and evidence concerning specific measured competencies, while dismissing badges for participating in courses or activities that lack such evidence as “attendance badges.” Others assume awarding badges only for measured competencies bypasses very important forms of social and inquiry-oriented learning, ignores the limitations of assessment and measurement, and limits the transformative potential of web-enabled evidence-rich credentials. An extended study of the 29 projects in the 2012 Badges for Lifelong Learning initiative provided a unique opportunity to explore this enduring debate.

This research started with simple features that had previously been refined in conventional online courses in order to foster more productive forms of disciplinary engagement. These features reflect five design principles for fostering productive forms of disciplinary engagement, motivating and assessing that engagement, and finally assessing the resulting individual understanding and achievement. This paper shows how these features were scaled up for use by hundreds of students in an open course and summarizes the impressive levels of disciplinary engagement and achievement that resulted. It also presents two new features that were introduced to allow self-paced participatory learning with little or no instructor involvement.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:21Z (GMT).

Adaptive scaffolding can support learners, but it requires understanding and responding to learner actions and strategies. We discuss a generalized adaptive scaffolding framework for OELEs based on a task and strategy model, and effectiveness and coherence measures for evaluating learner proficiencies for tasks and strategies. We apply this framework to support learners in CTSiM (Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling), a learning-by-modeling OELE for synergistic learning of science and computational thinking (CT). The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by a classroom study with two conditions. Students in the adaptive scaffolding condition showed a better understanding of science and CT concepts, built more accurate models, used better modeling strategies, and transferred modeling skills better to new scenarios than students in the control condition who received no adaptive scaffolding.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:21Z (GMT).

To investigate negotiation towards intersubjectivity along with students’ conceptual outcomes, we studied the discourse of two groups of middle-school students who participated in a 12-week science curriculum. We also evaluated differences in scores on a physics assessment. We found differences in how groups negotiated shared understandings of tasks and concepts and how they participated in conceptual discourse. Group A required significantly more instances of negotiation to establish intersubjectivity compared to Group B, indicating that Group A struggled with establishing shared understandings. Students in Group A also demonstrated greater variance in conceptual discourse and assessment scores, whereas Group B demonstrated more aligned conceptual outcomes. These results indicate that effective negotiation for establishing intersubjectivity is not only an important first step for students’ participation in conceptual discourse, but also for achieving balanced learning gains across group members.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:22Z (GMT).

In this paper, we report on the results of a design-based research study, in which 4th grade students used a web-based tool called Local Ground to collect data, model, and collaboratively analyze what’s underground in the local soil ecology around their school. We examine the affordances of situating children’s data modeling in local spaces and using Local Ground as a representational medium. We find that this instructional design supported children in integrating their experiential knowledge to reason about organisms in relation to the environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:23Z (GMT).

He has also criticized them for a retrograde conception of science. This paper starts by agreeing with his second point and elaborates it into a fuller critique of naïve scientific epistemology, arriving at the conclusion that a better epistemology points to a better pedagogy. The key is a programmatic view of science, which sees the scientific enterprise as working continually toward stronger explanations of natural phenomena. This is a program that can be joined by people at all levels of sophistication, including young children, the goal always being to make today’s ideas superior in some demonstrable way to yesterday’s. Engaging students in explanation improvement has numerous advantages over atheoretical inquiry and project-based activities. Knowledge Building is highlighted as an approach that gives idea improvement a central place in its pedagogy.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:24Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The basis for our analysis is a set of ethnographic video and field note records collected over several years of fieldwork. We scrutinize the moment-by-moment interactions among practitioners for episodes in which different modalities of embodied action are recruited and coordinated to produce and communicate complex meanings in the practice. As a whole, therefore, we seek to empower learners—as the ICLS 2016 calls for—by bringing insight into foundational aspects of knowing and learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:24Z (GMT).

In this study we explore the design of an 8th grade science curriculum featuring interactive virtual models and guided graph construction exercises to support learning about density and inquiry practices. We apply observations about students’ difficulties in the 1st iteration to the redesign of the curriculum. In particular, we observed that students’ often misinterpreted the virtual models or used them inappropriately to confirm prior ideas. Similarly, even when guided to construct appropriate graphs, students were unable to conceptually link the abstract representation to concrete conceptual knowledge. On the other hand, by centering student thinking on the data in the 2nd iteration and using the models to illustrate abstract concepts conveyed in graphs, students were more likely to perform appropriate investigations and develop coherent, integrated explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:25Z (GMT).

Therefore, we investigated to what extent a collaboration script helps students overcome their problems and acquire mathematical argumentation skills. In two previous studies, we showed that collaboration scripts can have positive effects on learning cross-domain argumentation skills in the mathematical context. Yet, the effectiveness of the script depended on individual prerequisites such as final high school grade (GPA) and self-regulation skills. In this study, N = 96 participants learned in one of three script conditions. We found that a high-structured domain-general collaboration script for argumentation was more effective for acquiring domain-specific mathematical argumentation skills than a low-structured or an adaptable one. Furthermore, only in the condition with the low-structured script, learners’ self-regulated learning skills played an important role for the learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:26Z (GMT).

That study raised questions about how to orchestrate a collaborative chat intervention in a MOOC context in order to provide the benefit of synchronous social engagement without the coordination difficulties. In this paper we present a careful analysis of an intervention designed to overcome coordination difficulties by welcoming students into the chat on a rolling basis as they arrive rather than requiring them to be matched with a partner before beginning. The results suggest the most positive impact when experiencing a chat with exactly one partner rather than more or less. A qualitative analysis of the chat data reveals differential experiences between these configurations that suggests a potential explanation for the effect and raises questions for future research.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:27Z (GMT).

The challenge in schools is to foster a culture of sustained, creative work with ideas, as in out-of-school Collaborative Innovation Networks (COINs) and cyberteams that self-organize to create knowledge. In this study, we examined the online knowledge work of three Knowledge Building classes, where young students assumed collective responsibility for creating and improving their community knowledge. We adopted the COIN concept of rotating leadership to visualize collective responsibility for knowledge advancement. Using a mixed methods approach, we conducted social and temporal network analyses, then content analyses of student notes to further assess cases of student leadership. Overall, we found relatively decentralized student networks, with most students leading the group at different points in time; when leading, students were connecting unique ideas to the larger class discussion. We discuss our findings within the context of designing embedded, transformative assessment for knowledge building communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:29Z (GMT).

This requires segmentation of the discourse data to define when connections are likely to be meaningful. In this paper, we present a novel approach to segmenting data for the purposes of modeling connections in discourse. Specifically, we use epistemic network analysis to model connections in student discourse using a temporal segmentation method adapted from recent work in the learning sciences. We compare the results to a purely topic-based segmentation method to examine the affordances of temporal segmentation for modeling connections in discourse.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:31Z (GMT).

Findings illustrate the emergence of an identity generative process: that engaging in science practices (e.g. presenting research) and the accompanying program resources (e.g. placing students in a position of power) generated new possibilities for students as capable science learners, scientists, and change agents. Furthermore, findings show that the instructor’s perspective of science and vision for his students guided the design of program resources (e.g. pedagogy, instruction) made available that helped create these shifts. Findings show that youth of color can imagine new possibilities for who they can be in science if their science and racial identities are supported in science programs.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:34Z (GMT).

Social support from parents can be essential to engaging children, but for parents with limited backgrounds in computing, they are often unsure what roles they can play. For parents to develop supportive roles, they must gain first-hand experience in creative computing for themselves and with their children. In this paper, we examine the experiences of parents participating in a community-based program called Family Creative Learning, where families design and invent together using creative technologies like Scratch. We describe three case studies of how parents developed multiple roles such as collaborator, teacher, and learner as they created and collaborated with their children on technology-based projects. We discuss design opportunities to provide meaningful experiences for parents and children to build projects and build supportive roles around computing.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:35Z (GMT).

In this comparative case study, we take a situative view of learning to examine the learning opportunities afforded in workgroup meetings with middle-school math teachers and pedagogically expert facilitators. Using interaction analysis, we analyze the role of representations in affording learning opportunities. The facilitators framed workgroup activity differently than the teachers; learning opportunities were limited when teachers were not able to engage the facilitators’ framings. But by introducing rich representations of practice, the facilitators attuned teachers’ attention to key conceptual resources. This scaffolded the workgroup into new forms of practice, thereby supporting teachers’ opportunities to learn more ambitious forms of professional practice. This work highlights the need for facilitators and instructional leaders to attend to issues of teacher learning in collaborative activity.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:35Z (GMT).

Focusing on this gap, we engaged in a mixed methods study that examined 17 schools in Hong Kong, consisting of 10 primary and 7 secondary schools. Altogether, 1,538 students from 55 classes and involving 53 teachers participated in the study which ran from September 2014 to June 2015. Building upon four key SDL representation models, we first developed our three-dimensional SDL conceptual framework to guide our analysis of the specific leadership-, teacher-, and student-related factors that could foster SDL in science education. Five key enabling factors are described.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

I call this model the “obj–subj dialectic,” and ultimately I posit that students’ respective semiotic means of objectification also function, simultaneously, as semiotic means of subjectification. I use this model to analyze and describe the individual student learning of three high school students engaged in a generalization task and the emergent social power dynamics. Findings show that whereas students made statements that positioned themselves as having the correct answer (i.e., as mathematical authorities), some students resorted to a broader arsenal of semiotic resources to make their point, which resulted in differentiated status positions. Thus some students gained “mathematical ascendency” over others, which refers to the co-construction of hierarchical positional identities emerging from the obj–subj dialectic during multimodal interactions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:37Z (GMT).

It can be argued that professionals do this better in groups than individually. Also, heterogeneous groups might have more potential to engage in higher levels of scientific reasoning than homogeneous groups or individuals. The present study investigated these questions in the context of teacher education. 76 teacher students solved a problem case from their future practice either individually or in dyads that were homo- or heterogeneous with respect to their members’ problem solving scripts. The results show that although dyads have an advantage on generating hypotheses to explain the problem; individuals engage more in generating solutions. Moreover, especially heterogeneous dyads seem to differ from individuals’ approaches. Future studies could investigate further how to use groups’ potential in generating hypotheses to facilitate them in generating solutions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:38Z (GMT).

Further, students who do study computational topics tend to not reflect the greater student body, with female and minority students being disproportionately underrepresented. To address these issues, we investigate the approach of embedding computational thinking content into required high school mathematics and science coursework. Using data from a 3-year implementation, we present results showing differences in attitudes towards computing by gender, while also finding similar gaps do not correlate with aptitude. Using pre/post measures, we then show female participants expressed improved confidence with computational thinking and interest in STEM careers. Additionally, we report a dosage effect, where participating in more activities resulted in greater learning gains, providing evidence in support of embedding computational thinking enhanced activities across high school curriculum.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:40Z (GMT).

We describe students’ learning gains and characterize the kinds of graphs they generate in terms of the graphical and scientific understanding demonstrated. This study contributes an example of how curriculum can be designed to simultaneously support students’ science and graph understanding. It also demonstrates how graphs can be used as expressive tools that both limit and enable students’ explanations of complex scientific processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:42Z (GMT).

The new standards are a radical departure from previous standards in their focus on science practices. Not only have general notions of inquiry been replaced by specific science practices students should learn, but the standards articulate a vision of instruction that places student engagement in science practices as the means though which science concepts should be learned. Teacher educators recognize this shift places profound demands on teachers and teacher learning. We report evidence from the start of an NGSS professional development project on how teachers’ understanding of the science practices emerges from their efforts to re-design instruction to align with them. Our analysis suggests teachers’ initial understanding is quite far from the vision of NGSS. We characterize this understanding and consider its implications for teacher professional development.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:44Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We positioned the learning trail as an integral part of the curriculum with a pre- and post-trail phase to scaffold and to support students’ meaning-making process. The study was conducted with two classes of secondary two students. We coded two groups’ discourse to examine the use of knowledge resource types in the meaning-making process in an outdoor learning setting: contextual resource, new conceptual resource, prior knowledge resource, as well as the relationship among these knowledge resource types. Next, we also examined environmental interaction and integration in the students’ use of these knowledge resource types. Analysis showed that contextual resources are chiefly instrumental in fostering students’ capacity to harness new conceptual resource and to activate prior knowledge resource in interacting with and integrating the outdoor learning environment in the meaning-making process.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:44Z (GMT).

We found that a combination of students’ constructive and active interaction (e.g., manipulating and constructing representations) with multiple fractions representations as compared to students’ active interaction (e.g., looking at representations) with multiple representations leads to higher conceptual knowledge measured by students’ ability to flexibly represent a fraction. Furthermore, students’ representational flexibility was correlated with their general learning performance when students’ interacted constructively and actively with representations but not when they interacted only actively with representations. In line with the ICAP-framework we conclude that active interactions trigger more intensively attending processes whereas constructive interactions trigger more intensively creating processes and are thus superior to the first kind of students’ cognitive engagement with multiple representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:45Z (GMT).

This study was guided by the theoretical framework that sustainable change requires sustained and aligned learning at multiple levels of the education system, and that greater scale in the innovation affords peer learning at multiple levels. It investigates the sustainability of three e-learning pilot projects in Hong Kong by studying the changes, if any, in (1) the e-learning pedagogical practices (the innovation) that was developed, and (2) the “architecture for learning” that was put into place at multiple levels in order to steer and implement the project, within the first school year after the formal 3-year funding ended. The findings indicate that the nature of the innovation as envisioned and the architecture for learning that was put into place in each project were critical in determining the subsequent sustainability of the projects.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-05-27T14:30:46Z (GMT).

However, research supporting this stance has employed questions that could be considered to be teleologically-leading, suggesting a partially inaccurate view of children's tendency to provide teleological explanations. This paper compares a teleologically-leading treatment (what is X for?) with an open-treatment (why is there X?), finding that the leading-treatment resulted in significantly more teleological explanations that the open-treatment. This suggests children's proposed bias to provide teleological rationales about the natural world may be being overestimated.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:28Z (GMT).

However, collaborative analysis of video is a complex social endeavor entailing numerous obstacles to learning, central among them face threats. In this study, we use linguistic ethnographic methods to investigate the implications for teacher face of using video in professional development, and the implications of teacher facework for their learning. We analyze 15 case studies of video-based discussions in school-based teacher teams, identifying and classifying face-threatening acts and the facework involved in responding to them. We then identify and analyze exemplary cases involving key facework strategies (face threat avoidance, face defending, and face correction), focusing on the ways these strategies opened up or closed down opportunities for learning. This study will contribute to our understanding of the interaction of social and cognitive dimensions of professional learning in general, and of teacher facework in video-based professional development.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:30Z (GMT).

While much of this research has looked at organizational practices and the embedded social networks within and across private firms, little research has reflexively considered academia. Yet, professional interactions within academic disciplines that cross narrow research specializations are critical for the continued advancement of public science. In this study, we employ a sequential mixed-methods study design to establish a base of empirical research that is introspective of the collaborative research environment of academia. We first employed purposeful semi-structured interviews to understand the value academic leaders place in cross-specialization interactions and then collected questionnaires from which we conducted statistical and social network analyses to describe the characteristics of and variation within disciplinary interaction networks and the relationships between network attributes and perceptions of a positive, collaborative learning environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:31Z (GMT).

Sixty-seven students were randomly assigned to receive the feedback that either fit or did not fit their RF. Results revealed a significant interaction between an individual’s RF and the type of feedback received after controlling for the student’s prior achievement. In particular, the students demonstrated better performance when receiving the fit feedback than the non-fit feedback. Further analysis of different performing groups showed that this identified interaction was significant only for the middle performing students, but not for the lower or higher performing groups. The findings suggested that the student’s RF may moderate the impact of feedback on students’ statistics performance, and this moderation pans out differently depending on the student’s previous achievement.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:32Z (GMT).

This study investigates how students use a computer model to connect design decisions and science concepts at different points during a design project. Students engaged in either planning or reflecting by using the model before building or after, respectively. Students in the planning condition used the model in an exploratory manner, while students in the reflecting condition used the model to confirm the results of their physical solar ovens. Results suggest that using the model is helpful during both phases, but using the model during the planning phase helped students to better integrate their ideas about energy.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:32Z (GMT).

Despite the increasing emphasis on scientific modeling in the community of science education, more information/research is needed to better inform teachers as to how they can support epistemically-rich, non-procedural engagement in modeling. In this study, we use Epistemologies in Practice as our theoretical framework to examine students’ engagement in modeling practice. We used a comparison approach to analyze 26 classroom video recordings in order to understand how two teachers framed modeling practices in the same modeling-based unit. In doing so, we analyzed what support teachers provided students as they engaged in modeling and how that might have led to students’ engagement in several epistemic aspects of modeling practices. Our findings suggest that how teachers framed the purpose and goals of modeling appeared to have a great influence on how students engaged in the modeling practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:33Z (GMT).

Here, we focus upon one case study within the context of an affiliate of the Network of Academic Programs in the Learning Sciences.

However, research on MA&P skills as well as their facilitation largely disregards this fact and effective means to foster the constituents and overall MA&P skills remain mainly unclear. Transferring research on the facilitation of complex cognitive skills from instructional design, two approaches may be effective: Fostering the constituents one by one respectively fostering them simultaneously. We therefore present an intervention study that takes a holistic approach on MA&P skills and their constituents, comparing a sequential (one-by-one) and an integrated (simultaneous) instructional approach to foster each constituent skill as well as students’ overall MA&P skills. The results show that learners in the integrated condition and the sequential condition have very similar learning gains that differ only in their mathematical strategic knowledge, which is superior in the integrated condition.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:34Z (GMT).

To guide students in this we created a configurable experiment design tool that is usable in multiple domains. The tool was tested with two configurations; one with a CVS structure in which learners had to design at least three experimental trials before conducting their experiment, and one in which this was not required. In the current study secondary students designed and conducted experiments in an online lab about buoyancy and Archimedes’ principle. Three conditions were compared in terms of students’ conceptual knowledge gain. Students worked with one configuration of the tool, or with no tool. Results showed significant differences between conditions for lower prior knowledge students’ learning gain about buoyancy.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:35Z (GMT).

Disinheritance offers new ways of combining design-based interventions with ethnography about design in a “marginalized” part of the world, and is necessarily also concerned with economics, politics and how they shape design on a global scale. Building on Vygotsky’s cultural heritage and Marx’s alienation, the theory of disinheritance sets a new programmatic agenda for learning sciences research.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:36Z (GMT).

A clustering analysis of students’ regulation scripts revealed that they developed scripts through a variety of trajectories. Further case studies suggested: (1) that students develop their scripts when they recognized meaningful challenges, (2) that they construct scripts of socially shared regulation when they recognize epistemic challenge whereas they do co-regulation scripts when they recognize socio-emotional challenge.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:36Z (GMT).

Due to constraints of resources and designs, building “productive moments of uncertainty” (Manz, 2015) into the classroom to facilitate argumentation is challenging. This study addresses such challenge by analyzing how 6th graders resolve disagreements when evaluating epistemic and disciplinary claims. Preliminary findings suggest that talking about epistemic concerns without disciplinary engagement is not productive. Embedding epistemic practice in resolving disciplinary disagreements, however uncomplicated it may seem, would foster productive argumentation. Understanding what disagreements are challengingly resolvable and how both epistemic and disciplinary practices play a role in evaluating claims thus sheds needed light on designing effective learning environments that foster deep learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:37Z (GMT).

Also, studies that combine both objective and subjective data around these practices are still rare. This study responds to these challenges in exploration of student teachers’ collaborative problem solving (CPS) processes. Relevant events in CPS tasks are tracked through process data acquired via ATC21S™ portal, and complemented with students’ interpretations of these processes as cued retrospective reports. The broader aim is to provide student teachers with hands-on experiences of using novel, technology-enhanced formative assessment systems for 21st century skills. It is hypothesised that familiarity with these practices will guide student teachers to be more open toward formative, technology-enhanced assessment culture as they move into professional practice as teachers.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:37Z (GMT).

This paper examines the meaning of authenticity and relevance in science education from an interactional perspective. Particularly, it compares and contrasts authenticity with productive disciplinary engagement, and relevance with expansive framing.  We then use this comparison to discuss the tension between maintaining accountability to the discipline and fostering students’ agency and authority; a tension that is not sufficiently addressed in science education literature that addresses the conceptualization of authenticity and relevance. We suggest a research agenda that aims to resolve this tension by problematizing and articulating in fine detail the theoretical meaning of productive disciplinary engagement and expansive framing for science classrooms that are deeply immersed in authentic scientific practices and discourse.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:38Z (GMT).

Within the context of the Watershed Stewards Academy, we aim to understand how participants bring diverse perspectives and experiences, interact with one another, and engage in environmental learning and action. Our analysis traces learners’ development from becoming aware of the importance of stormwater management to the watershed’s health to taking leadership roles in their communities. Our findings point to the potential of new face-to-face strategies and technology that can aid learners in interacting and learning together.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:38Z (GMT).

We inductively analyzed online discussion posts and identified three themes that described the groups’ processes for externalizing and internalizing understanding: level of engagement with content, approach to seeking and providing help, and openness to disagreement and problem-solving. The group with the highest mean self-regulation scores elaborated upon course concepts, helped one another understand and apply ideas, and integrated viewpoints to carry out course activities. The group with the lowest scores wrote about surface-level features, exchanged help in a brief and depersonalized manner, and moved quickly to consensus without evaluating alternative perspectives.

Participants were pre-service mathematics teachers (N = 47) enrolled in a course about feedback and assessment. Quantitative content analysis was used to analyze students’ reflections after being involved in a peer feedback provision activity on a geometry construction task. Students’ reflections illustrated that the composition process is not purely cognitive, and can also involve self-reflection and self-evaluation activities as well as peer-related activities. Some examples of self- and peer-related activities during peer feedback composition are reported, followed by a discussion of implications for using peer feedback as a learning activity.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:40Z (GMT).

To better understand what authentic practice looks like in a classroom, we examine interactions between scientists and students on a social media platform during two pilot enactments of a project-based curriculum focusing on the ecological impacts of climate change. Scientists provided feedback to students on infographics meant to communicate to an audience about climate change. We conceptualize the feedback and student work as boundary objects co-created by students and scientists, and analyze the structure and content of the scientists' feedback.  We found that in feedback on a particular practice scientists encouraged students to participate systemically in practices instead of isolating one practice. Engaging with scientists around established scientific texts and data sets provided students with a platform for developing expertise in other important scientific practices during argument construction.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:41Z (GMT).

The course was taught using the EMBeRS method that emphasizes generation of external representations of mental models to build shared understanding of socio-environmental systems (Pennington et al., 2015). The design approach adopted combined expertise in (1) design research (from Sandoval, 2014) and (2) design for learning (from Carvalho & Goodyear, 2014). Taking a systems view of the design, activity, and learning outcomes, this paper describes the linkages between these and extracts the design conjectures of the instructor and the theoretical conjectures implicit in the EMBeRS approach. In collaboration with the instructor, the use of this approach: identified disconnects between design and theoretical conjectures; linked these disconnects to specific design considerations so that; recommendations for areas of redesign and parallel research were made.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:41Z (GMT).

In this exploratory study, we examine the different levels of team effectiveness and describe the varying patterns of teamwork competency dimensions from students’ online problem-solving chatlogs. We employed two types of measures for a holistic understanding of team effectiveness, namely, task performance scores and learners’ perception of how effective they are as a team. Teams were categorized into four levels of team effectiveness based on the measures. A content analysis of teamwork competency dimensions was also performed. Our findings revealed the need for balance in teamwork competency behaviors for effective learning teams. Insights from the findings could lead to design principles for interventions to nurture teamwork competency in our 21st century learners.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:42Z (GMT).

While curriculum design literature gives some guidance for designers, most work in this area focuses on design by small design teams working on materials for relatively narrow contexts. To further inform the work of science curriculum designers, we conducted two retrospective case studies of curricula designed for large-scale use. Qualitative data were collected through document analysis and interviews with key design team members. Data were analyzed deductively and inductively. Here we focus on findings about the influence of policy and cultural context, and the ways in which the needs of target student and teacher populations are considered during curriculum development. The findings are useful to other designers concerned with bringing science content and practices to broad audiences of diverse learners.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:43Z (GMT).

These efforts have begun to help diversify computing and engineering by encouraging young people who are underrepresented in these fields to consider them from a different perspective. Computing projects in these environments are often collaborative and require students with varying backgrounds and perspectives to work together. We propose that the coordination between the participants is facilitated in the presence of their differences through the computational artifacts they create, which serve as boundary objects. Furthermore, integrating art into these interventions promotes abstract thinking, enabling the boundary objects to flow more seamlessly between weakly and strongly structured implementations and interpretations. We examine this proposition within a case study of a dance and technology workshop. We highlight how students and leaders negotiated and accepted differences within their perspectives and interpretations of the dances they created.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:43Z (GMT).

We speculate that the ways that students reason about social phenomena share enough similarities with how they reason about physical and life sciences that we can use existing work on mechanistic reasoning to characterize students’ explanations of social phenomena. We apply an existing framework for analyzing student reasoning about life sciences to students’ explanations of a social phenomenon relating to urban planning.  In comparing these analyses, we propose a component of student reasoning that may be specific to reasoning about social phenomena: social factor backing. We show that incorporating this component into the existing framework providers a fuller account of our data.  Finally, we discuss why we think this element could be important for future studies of students’ mechanistic reasoning about social phenomena.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:44Z (GMT).

We argue that (a) a deterministic perspective is as useful as a probabilistic one, (b) even experts implicitly exhibit (do not lose) deterministic assumptions, (c) probabilistic mental models are built on top of deterministic models, using multiple instances of the phenomena of interest, and (d) expertise involves willfully switching between pre- and post-threshold assumptions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:44Z (GMT).

We conducted an experimental study in situ in three fourth-grade classes in a public school in Singapore, manipulating the way that students prepared for a collaborative activity in a topic in environmental education.

In this study we wanted to enable N = 81 participants to produce contributions of higher quality due to focused selection towards relevant contents. We conducted both qualitative and quantitative analyses on Wiki contributions. The addition of visual highlights indicating controversies reinforced students to direct their attention towards important contents discussing the study’s subject matter. When their selection behaviour was positively influenced it resulted in higher quality and more elaborate contributions to discussion threads and to the final revision of an article.

Twenty-two college freshmen participated in this qualitative research to provide feedback on their peer’s written arguments about popular psychology topics. Constant comparative analysis of multiple data sources revealed three main categories of feedback that students provided: cognition-based, metacognition-based, and affection-based. While receiving cognition-based feedback had the most impacts on how students would later evaluate others’ work, those who had previously provided metacognition-based feedback were more likely to make observed progress in constructing arguments. This work adds to our understanding about the complex nature of peer assessment and proposes a potentially effective approach to facilitate students’ skills in written argumentation.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:46Z (GMT).

Previous research has identified surface characteristics of the OKC dialog as integrativity predictors. Yet, little is known about the role of dialogic textual complexity. This contribution proposes a comprehensive approach based on previously validated textual complexity indexes and applies it to predict OKC integrativity. The dialog analysis of N = 14 blogger communities with a total of 1937 participants identified three main components of textual complexity: dialog participation, structure and cohesion. From these, dialog cohesion was higher in integrative OKCs, thus significantly predicting OKC integrativity. This result adds to previous OKC research by uncovering the depth of OKC discourse. For educational practice, the study suggests a way of empowering learners by automatically assessing the integrativity of OKCs in which they may attempt to participate and access community knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:47Z (GMT).

In makerspaces and other sites where problems are posed in physical form, the material affordances of the objects and their spatial configurations can aid or hinder the search through problem space for possible solutions. In this study, we present the preliminary results of a study involving six pairs of grade eight students involved in a school makerspace context. Given sixteen littleBits modules housed in a small toolbox, along with some light construction materials, students were tasked to produce a prototype of a device that could attract teachers’ attention during class work sessions. The material actions that students made in early explora-tion of project ideas were correlated to the creative outcomes of their project.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:49Z (GMT).

This case reflects a need for attention to multidimensional data and narrative design in research on data visualization literacy.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:51Z (GMT).

This study attempts to account for these problems by developing a user interface that facilitates learning scientists to analyze SRA, enabling them to evaluate the performance of an automated coding algorithm and supporting them to recognize patterns in the coded data using flexible visualizations. The usability and the comprehensibility of the user interface have been tested by means of a user study in an online performance test.

Data from 26 children in a summer camp program include log files, field notes, and video-records. Our findings illustrate how an iBeacon system supported children’s playful and scientific engagement (including in observational practices). We provide insights into designing for learner-centered mobile computing that moves beyond presenting just-in-time information to creating digital-physical spaces where learners engage each other and natural objects to support their interests in science.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:52Z (GMT).

We first examine whether agency can explain variance in standardized mathematics scores. Regression analysis indicates home language and agency had a significant effect on mathematics scores. We then turn to data collected through extended participant observation to characterize decisions students make. Based on these, we detail a developmental agency trajectory: dis/engagement agency serves as a covert means for students to learn; makerly agency serves as an entry point for students to explore and develop interests, and designerly agency allows students to take ownership of design problems and learn as they do so.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:53Z (GMT).

To understand the difference in learning gains, we analyzed the discourse of the students and teacher as they worked in groups during the labs. We found three main categories of discourse: conceptual talk, task-based talk, and teacher scaffolding. Our analysis of discourse showed that students in the virtual group engaged in more conceptual talk than the physical group, while the physical group had more task-based talk.

Such database systems must also support transparent and efficient search and selection of data to enable rapid analysis by design teams as well as collaborative data sharing and analysis by multiple researchers. This paper outlines one system devised by a team of design-based researchers for documenting their research process and organizing their data. Inspired by the hierarchical workflow model suggested by Hackbarth et al. (2010), this approach employs a combination of visual modeling and data tagging to organize and support rapid access and sharing of a large DBR databank. The suggested approach is available to most researchers, including those who might not have access to sophisticated database resources and knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:42:57Z (GMT).

Using the perspective of Lakoff and Johnson (2003)’s conceptual metaphors, our analysis identified a set of four metaphorical perspectives – CCCs AS LENSES, CCCs AS BRIDGES, CCCs AS TOOLS, and CCCs AS RULES – that the texts use to describe the role of CCCs in three-dimensional science learning.

This paper analyzes to what and how a teacher attends as noteworthy events in the classroom and investigates his associated enacted responses. The construct of teacher noticing was used to identify examples of teacher noticing attuned to students’ ideas associated with responsive actions in the classroom in which the teacher supported knowledge building by empowering students to see and make connections to their own and one another’s knowledge work and the ongoing trajectory of inquiry.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:01Z (GMT).

The result was that the cognitive development is improved in the structured CPS learning tasks under the mediation of semantic diagram tools. While, the basic understanding, rather than the high level understanding of learning topic is improved. What’s more, the CPS interaction, rather than the CPS engagement make the positive contribution to the cognitive development. This finding gives some insight of design of the CPS learning task and semantic diagram tools in the future study.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, it has been less examined whether the effect still holds when the generative task does not involve problem solving. Using a 2x2 experimental design, this study investigated the effects of generative tasks that involve analogical problem posing (without solving) on learning and transfer. Pedagogical sequence (i.e., generation-first or instruction-first) and type of analogical reasoning task (i.e., generating one’s own analogical problems or generating analogical mappings between given analogical problems) were the two factors manipulated. Preliminary analysis revealed no multivariate effects of the factors. Thus, we discuss the learning mechanisms enacted by analogical reasoning, reliability of the instruments, and the participants’ prior condition as possible reasons and to inform future studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:03Z (GMT).

For this study the authors developed interview protocols on several topics that involve numbers increasing linearly and exponentially. Students’ verbal and gestural responses during the interviews were transcribed, coded, categorized and analyzed. Results showed that students display a breadth of context-dependent gestures, that their verbal reasoning is associated with the type of gesture they produce, and that gesture-speech mismatches are present in middle school students’ reasoning about scale. Implications of this study include design guidelines for an interactive system that standardizes and structures scale-related gestures.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:04Z (GMT).

Specifically we examine what happens when explicit attention and reflection is brought to students’ own gestures. Interviews were conducted with middle school students about their understanding of 3 critical science topics, and participants were frequently asked by the interviewer to “show me” when attempting to describe the unobservable mechanisms (e.g., molecular interactions) underlying observable phenomena. To understand the effects of prompting for gestures on student reasoning, we coded for whether explanations changed in response to these prompts compared to their previous explanations. Results showed that explicit attention to gesturing frequently led to increased attention and specification of mechanism. We describe a few specific cases to illustrate the ways in which gesturing seemed to alter student reasoning, and we describe design implications for computer simulations that are capable of using gestures as input.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:05Z (GMT).

Data were collected from 80 university students enrolled in mathematics study programs. Participants first answered a series of multiple choice questions regarding knowledge of basic geometry theorems and afterwards solved a complex proof task. Immediately upon task completion, students reported their epistemic emotions as well as motivation during the task. Path analyses revealed that epistemic emotions during problem solving predicted the motivation students invested in solving the complex reasoning task. Finally, intrinsic motivation positively predicted task performance. The findings suggest complex linkages of epistemic emotions with motivational mechanisms during reasoning and knowledge generating processes and demonstrate the adaptive and maladaptive functions of epistemic emotions. Consequently their role for complex reasoning should be considered in future research and can guide instructional design to foster reasoning in mathematics.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:06Z (GMT).

Video provides unique analytical affordances to researchers but also presents unique tensions, many of which have not yet been adequately addressed in the literature. The authors of this symposium draw on their diverse experiences, analyzing a variety of video corpuses, to provide theoretical and methodological standards and heuristics for the process of video analysis. We focus on three themes central to the process of video analysis that would benefit from increased theoretical and methodological attention: transcription tensions, defining the unit of analysis, and representing context. We discuss how our approaches to video analysis are framed by theory and how we have applied them to specific datasets, to answer a variety of research questions. In doing so, we make explicit some crosscutting methodological norms and invite continued discussion about these norms from multiple analytic traditions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:07Z (GMT).

We share efforts examining how sharing artifacts, documenting design processes, and providing feedback via online tools can support young makers in creating physical artifacts and offer insights to new assessment models.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:09Z (GMT).

Scaling up procedures involve small networks of teachers, education leaders and researchers working together to design, practice and reflect lessons across subjects, schools and districts. The set of strategies developed provides a common Knowledge Constructive Jigsaw framework or set of “constraints” to guide the practices of participants for reflection on learning and to expand children’s potential to learn, teachers’ potential to support student learning, and policy makers’ potential to support teacher learning. Building Cultural Capacity for Innovation represents a vision shared by teams in Japan and internationally to transform schools into knowledge creating organizations, to learn from one another, and to—in Naomi’s words--support a science of practice deeply embedded in the learning sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:14Z (GMT).

It is claimed that when learners draw they engage in ways that help them evaluate and transform their understanding, practice fundamental disciplinary practices and provides the basis for formative or summative assessment. This symposium draws together research on student drawing across different disciplines (e.g. Chemistry, Biology, and Anatomy) to explore the value that drawing can have in learning science and medicine. Importantly, the papers take a nuanced view of the value of drawing; attempting to avoid the sometimes overblown claims that accompany calls for particular approaches to education by addressing situations when drawing has been found to be ineffective as well as helpful. They will also focus on analysis on process data (e.g. drawings) to provide insight into when particular representational practices are helpful and how they most be executed and supported to gain these benefits","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:15Z (GMT).

SGIs place students’ ideas at the center of learning designs, considering the learning process as well as the learning goals/outcomes. By soliciting and foregrounding students’ diversified ideas in the classroom and beyond, the learning environment communicates to students that their ideas matter to others and that they have a position of responsibility to their own and their peers’ learning processes. The notion of SGIs is embodied in a repertoire of studies at the Learning Sciences Lab, National Institute of Education, Singapore, that offer varied yet overlapping interpretations of how student ideas can inform the design of learning contexts. In sharing the core design principles for SGIs approaches, this work contributes important components to the learning sciences discipline and changing educational practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:16Z (GMT).

People can and do get interested in STEM-based activities in the various spaces in which they encounter these activities—e.g., the home, museums, hobby fields, school, and after-school programs. However, because each such setting operates under different constraints and affordances, the forms of interest-based participation they spawn and support are qualitatively different. This symposium brings together four distinct research projects, each of which addresses very different settings, aspects, and phenomena in people’s interest-based participation in STEM. The projects also deploy very different methodologies to document and measure people’s interests. By comparing and contrasting these very distinct takes on interests and their manifestations across settings, we gain insight into both generalities and context specific aspects of interests and their enactment.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:17Z (GMT).

This symposium will showcase and discuss four diverse efforts to advance open learning at scale that are directly informed by contemporary theories of learning and educational research methods. This includes research on inquiry-based community learning, computer-mediated discourse analysis, participatory approaches to learning and assessment, and evidence-rich digital-credentials. In each of the four cases, the desire to extend that program of research to learning at scale resulted in significant advances in the more general program of research.

Its theoretical roots lie in the sociocultural tradition, in particular Vygotsky’s view that the inter-mental with practice becomes interiorized and transformed into the intra-mental.  We report on the gains observed among successive cohorts, relative to close comparison groups who engaged in non-dialogic whole-class discussion. Gains are seen both in dialogic argumentation and in individual written argument, specifically with respect to counterargument and the use of evidence.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T09:43:23Z (GMT).
