In our analysis of knowledge construction, we were able to identify four aspects. 1) Imparting a certain view of the world knowledge creation provided an ideological guidance system. 2) Role structure within the community the entire communication was centered on one individual expert who played the role of a kind of guru. 3) Persuasion and reinforcement of followers the impartment of knowledge and persuasion were primarily based on an emotional type of communication. 4) Separation from ""dissidents"" the attitude towards people of a ""different faith"" and towards standard medicine was characterized by strong hostility and rejection.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:22Z (GMT).

However, students may face challenges while constructing meaning through dialogue. This study explored multiple forms of support to foster collaboration that would lead to a deeper understanding of science ideas and high-quality group concept maps. Ninety-five students from four 8th grade science classrooms participated in this study. Using a 2 x 2 experimental design, we examined the effect of teacher modeling of prompts and the effect of meaningful individual preparation prior to collaboration on the quality of students' concept maps. Statistical analyses revealed that groups that prepared individual concept maps and received teacher modeling of prompts generated the highest quality concept maps. Further, teacher modeling of prompts was only found to be effective when combined with the individual preparation of concept maps prior to collaboration. Implications for classroom practice and future research are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:25Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Exploratory search tasks are attempts at such learning and require cognitive, strategic, and interpretive work from the user. The pathways of such searches are likewise complex and nuanced. The present study attempts to enable the human work that goes into conducting exploratory searches to be efficiently captured and transmitted to other learners. By this method, web search expertise can transfer socially and implicitly between users instead of developing individually or through directed learning. The system we deployed uses an existing metaphor, the timeline, to structure insights from searches. We refer to these semantically meaningful representations as `weblines'. We deployed a live system to 81 users in three user populations. The resulting weblines were delineated into four types. Successful weblines were those that participants used to iteratively reflect upon the insights of their searches.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:28Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The aim of our study was to promote university students' web design skills through online design-based learning (DBL). Combined in a 2x2-factorial design, two types of scaffolding were implemented in an online DBL environment to support the students through their effort to design, build, modify, and publish web sites on processes and outcomes measures, namely collaboration scripts and incomplete concept maps. The results showed that both treatments had positive effects on domain-specific knowledge acquisition and on content-related discourse quality and collaboration skills in a subsequent discussion. There was synergism between the two scaffolds in that the combination of the collaboration script and incomplete concept maps produced the most positive results. To be effective, online DBL thus needs to be enhanced by appropriate scaffolds, and both collaboration scripts and incomplete concept maps are effective examples.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:34Z (GMT).

This paper describes and demonstrates the utility of the Repertory Grid Technique to probe such perceptions. Combining interviews and written surveys, this study uncovered constructs that engineering students' use to think about CW/peer-reviewing, and interesting patterns of relations among those constructs. For instance, while students perceived activities that involve the construction of personal arguments (such as CW) to be exciting and effective for learning, they also judged such activities to be time-consuming and stressful. This study also found interesting differences in the construct systems of high- and low-performing students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This paper focuses on students' on-campus face-to-face collaborative learning process. We derive a novel visualization approach for descriptive analysis of the small group activities inspired by the notions of mediation by artifacts and distributed cognition to provide a synoptic view of the process of student artifact co-creation in such collaborative activities. The artifact-oriented analysis and visualization approach is our preliminary attempt in making sense of how the seamless learning process may look like in the perspective of learners' individual and collaborative learning experiences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:35Z (GMT).

Yet, for novice learners, positive outcomes also depend on effective guidance of group interactions. In this paper, we present empirical evidence for the use of web-based video tools to support students' collaborative learning in a history class. In an experiment with 16-year old learners (N=148) working with a history topic, we compared two contrasting types of guidance for student collaboration in dyads (cognitive task-related guidance or social interaction-related guidance). We also compared two types of video tools. Both types of guidance and tools were aimed at supporting students' active, meaningful learning and critical reflection. Results indicate that social interaction-related guidance was more effective in terms of learning outcome (e.g., critical reflection skills) than cognitive task- related guidance. The different tools did not yield significant differences in learning. The practical implications of these results are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:35Z (GMT).

We analyze and discuss the properties of the interactive setting as well as the interactions with and around the system using characteristics such as multiple modalities of response, large space interaction and aspects of focus and attention. The work suggests that alternative pedagogical activities can be created providing new entries to theoretical concepts using an embodied interaction approach.

The mCSCL application assigns each student a component of a Chinese character and requires them to spontaneously form groups that can assemble a Chinese character. We observe the enactment of the learning design in two modes (with and without the ICT), and found the students favor the card mode over the phone mode due to their emergent trial-and- error strategy. That triggered us to examine the scaffolding strategies by exploring domain- oriented theories to inform us in deciding how we should accommodate their use of the strategy. This cycle of DBR has reshaped our learning design. This paper brings to the fore the value of the interplay of theories, implementations and reflections as advocated by DBR.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:36Z (GMT).

Much less emphasis has been placed on studying massive communities and participation in large groups prominent in today's social networking sites and online gaming cultures that would shift the focus to `collective' learning (i.e., the abilities needed to participate and support collaborations in massive groups).

We contrast two cases to illustrate how gaze cross-recurrence can be used as a correlate of high and low quality interaction. The intriguing graphical patterns that result from the time coupled traces of the collaborators' fixations are footprints of the quality of the interaction. Good quality interaction features a higher recurrence rate than low quality interaction.

Typical scenarios that are being trained virtually are of high complexity, require intensive communication between team members, consist of situations in which individual human beings are in danger, and are not trainable in real-life situations. In this paper we describe the virtual training environment VirtualPolice. Its theory-based development process is explicated to show how theory was connected to practice. We present which specific needs were evaluated in order to define training goals. We introduce our theoretical base and argue why such virtual training environments can support the acquisition of knowledge-in-use, the ability of team members to take the perspective of others, and reflection of team performance. This makes it possible to identify those features of virtual training environments that enable successful training, and to point out how these may be implemented.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:37Z (GMT).

We analyzed the products of 10 groups (32 students) and the chat discussions of the group members, and we assessed the quality of the group products. The results of the study offer an insight into how students select and integrate semantic information. Most noticeable results show that groups synthesized the information selected from sources based on ideas rather than sources and created new conceptual connections among these ideas. Relationships were found between the quantity and type of information and the products quality, while weak or no relationships were found between type and frequency of chat talk with the degree of integration in the group products.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:37Z (GMT).

Groupthink is a term coined by psychologist (Janis, 1972), Groupthink victims ignore alternatives and tend to make irrational decisions in facing crises. Many researchers suggest that role play simulation (RPS) is a suitable tool for crisis management training for the realisation of collaboration and authentic situation awareness. In this paper, a case study of crisis management training in the context of law enforcement using online RPS is illustrated. By using Bales' Interaction Process Analysis (IPA) method, the interactions of participants in training are observed and categorised. The results show that using online role play simulation in crisis management training has positive effect on the reduction of Groupthink tendency.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:38Z (GMT).

Results indicated that the group that engaged most frequently in monitoring the understanding of group members, evaluating ideas and generating questions to share with the class developed the most sophisticated scientific conceptions. Simply navigating the hypertext system effectively and engaging in elaborated science reasoning was not sufficient for students to develop sophisticated conceptual understandings, reiterating the importance of helping young learners to actively reflect on their understanding and question development during collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:39Z (GMT).

This paper proposes a set of visualisations which aim to give teachers insights into longitudinal participation of each group member, an indication of the extent of each learner's contribution and the building process of the group product in terms of overall activity towards a good solution. We exploit the affordances of tabletops to capture the data in order to infer these visualisations. We evaluate these by assessing whether facilitators could answer key questions about aspects of groups. Key contributions of the paper are the design of new visualisations, results of their evaluation and the implementation of a tabletop concept mapping application which was carefully designed to both support collaboration and capture of the history of the collaborative process.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:40Z (GMT).

In triads secondary education students worked on a case-based business-economics problem in a predefined order, but differed in the representational tool(s) they received. In the matched condition, teams received the three tools in a part-task congruent manner. In the other three non-matched conditions, teams received one of the tools for all three part-tasks, thus a tool congruent to one part-task and incongruent for the other two. The results show that coordination processes were indeed better which might explain why teams in the matched condition performed better on the complex problem-solving task. However, similar results were obtained by teams who only received a tool for constructing causal representations for all part-tasks.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:40Z (GMT).

How, in turn, might engineering and testing such design aid us in building theory of learning? We draw on media studies to argue that activities situated at the hybrid intersection of two media, for example physical-virtual interfaces, enable both learners and their researchers to objectify important notions. We evoke cultural-historical psychology theory, which implicates gesture as the ontogenesis of inscription, to interpret instructional EI as offering analogous enactive-semiotic tension and resolution. We support our view with selected empirical data from a design-based research project investigating the emergence of mathematical concepts from mediated engagement in EI activity. Specifically, we present, analyze, and juxtapose two case studies respectively illustrating student success or failure to grope toward a conceptual system (proportions) embedded in a technological system (EI).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:41Z (GMT).

One of the most popular existing mathematics help forums, Cramster, is an advocate of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), and promotes the provision of worked solutions. The purpose of this project was to ascertain the quality of the worked solutions that students are receiving, by analyzing 128 threads from the Algebra thru Pre-Calculus site archives from two perspectives. First, a rubric based on research-based design principles of worked examples was used to distinguish poor from well- structured solutions. Second, student ratings of solutions they received were examined and compared with the research-based ratings. The results show that Cramster is providing students with responses that contain steps, and sometimes goals, as opposed to final answers only. However, there is also much misinformation in the responses, and students do not show much discernment in their ratings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:41Z (GMT).

A case study of two secondary students working together to solve a chemical equilibrium problem illustrates how students privilege one representation, yet problem solve by collaboratively integrating information from multiple representations. Working with the environment, individual students make a rapid initial judgment about which displayed representation is most useful for a particular task and ignore information presented in other representations unless their peers prompt them to use that information. Analyzed individually, each student would appear to lack representational competence, yet together the dyad demonstrates sophisticated coordination of representations. Using these observations, the study posits that an individual student's difficulties with coordinating representations can be mitigated by embedding multi-representational displays in collaborative activities that foster argumentation about representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:41Z (GMT).

In this paper, we evaluate the impact of using an argumentation system with different argument ontologies and with collaborative vs. individual use on the outcomes of scientific argu- mentation. The results of a controlled lab study with 36 participants indicate that simple ontologies may be more appropriate than highly structured ones. In addition, collaborative argumentation lead to more cluttered argumentation maps, including a higher amount of erroneously used and duplicate elements, which indicates that an expected peer-reviewing between group members did not occur. Yet, groups also tended to include more points-of- view in their arguments, leading to more elaborated argument maps.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Given the scarcity of primary studies that report correlations between these two variables, a meta-regression approach was used that uses interventions' effects on argumentation to predict their effects on domain-specific knowledge. Effect sizes for 17 comparisons extracted from 12 studies were included in the analysis using a random-effects model. On average, the interventions have a small to moderate effect on argumentation. With respect to the relation of their effects on argumentation to their effects on domain-specific knowledge, no unequivocal picture emerges. These findings call into question the broadly shared theoretical assumption that argumentation can be a mechanism that mediates the effects of interventions on domain-specific knowledge. A set of recommendations for strengthening future research on the topic is presented.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Despite this complexity dialogic space can be operationalized in concrete designs for learning. Some general principles are developed through a review of the literature on the indirect relationship between communications technologies and dialogic space. The EC funded Argunaut and Metafora projects to design online dialogic education environments are then used to illustrate more specific affordances of online design for a dialogic pedagogy.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:42Z (GMT).

An online learning system that allows students to contribute to and benefit from the process of question-generation and peer- assessment was adopted. Data analysis revealed significant relationships among the three examined variables. Additionally, the identity revelation modes moderated the predictive power of online question-generation performance on academic achievement. Specifically, the predictive power in the self-choice mode was the greatest. Finally, self-choice identity mode strengthened the relationships between peer-assessment and question-generation performances.

Radar allows group members to assess themselves and their fellow group members on six traits related to social and cognitive behavior. Reflector stimulates group members to reflect individually and collaboratively on their past, present, and future functioning. The underlying assumption was that Radar in combination with Reflector would lead to (1) more reliable peer assessment scores, and (2) more valid perceptions of the social performance of the group. Participants were 191 second year academic students working in groups of three, four or five, on a collaborative writing task. As expected, results showed that the use of a reflection tool in a CSCL environment leads to more reliable peer assessment scores and more valid perceptions of the groups' social performance.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:43Z (GMT).

Previous studies suggest that this relationship may be different for different age-groups. This study was conducted with two classes of students--at grades 6 and 10 respectively. The discourse was analyzed at both thread- and individual-student- levels. It was found that for the sixth-grade students, those who asked better questions also expressed better knowledge ideas. For the tenth-grade students, such a relationship at the individual-student-level was not found. Nonetheless, at the thread-level, there is a positive correlation between the presence of better questions and more developed knowledge ideas in the tenth-grade students' online discourse, but not in the sixth- grade students'. The results suggest further discourse characteristics in addition to questioning to be related to the quality of knowledge ideas expressed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:43Z (GMT).

In this paper, we discuss the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant (APTA), an adaptive support system for computer-mediated peer tutoring in high-school Algebra. We conducted an after-school study with 122 participants where we compared APTA to two fixed support conditions: one where we told students support was adaptive when it was not, and one where we told students support was fixed. These manipulations explored two hypotheses: Adaptive support is effective because it is relevant to student behaviors, and support that is perceived to be adaptive is effective because it makes students feel accountable for their actions. APTA showed better effects on tutor and tutee learning compared to the other conditions, suggesting that the more relevant the support, the more beneficial it will be.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:43Z (GMT).

In a Lantern-equipped recitation section, every team is provided with one Lantern which shows the current status of that team: the exercise they are working on, if they called the teaching assistants for help, and since when. The results show that (1) Lantern increases intra-team collaboration while teams are waiting for teaching assistants and (2) it increases the diversity of inter-team communication, that is, each team communicates with a larger number of other teams, and there are fewer teams who never communicate with others.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:45Z (GMT).

The awareness tool involved mutual ratings of contributions on dimensions that make minority opinions more salient. In order to dissociate between the potentially facilitative functions of rating interfaces and visualized feedback, a control condition was compared to a rate-only condition and a tool condition using visualized feedback about ratings. Results indicated that rating without feedback did not strengthen minority viewpoints, but rather widened the differences between minority and majority factions. The group awareness tool that used ratings and visualized feedback yielded moderate effects on minority influence, strong effects on the perceived group preference, and a more pronounced task focus. The results are discussed with regard to the relation of group awareness to different types of social influence and different types of self-awareness.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:45Z (GMT).

This paper explores authoritativeness of stance within a conversation as a social factor influencing learning and related to self-efficacy in a computer-supported collaborative learning setting. Our results indicate that this authoritativeness measure predicts learning, where an individual's self- efficacy does not, and that student and partner authoritativeness predicts group self-efficacy. Further research is required to better determine the relationship between conversational authoritativeness, individual dispositions, and learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:45Z (GMT).

However, the diversity of perspectives often remains unexploited: Learners prefer preference-consistent over preference-inconsistent information, a phenomenon called confirmation bias. Two lab experiments were designed to test whether technologies such as recommender systems can be used to overcome this bias. The role of preference- inconsistent recommendations was explored by comparing their influence to a condition with preference-consistent recommendations and to a control condition without recommendations. In Study 1, preference-inconsistent recommendations led to a reduction of confirmation bias and to an attenuation of preferences. In Study 2, we found that preference-inconsistent recommendations stimulated balanced recall and divergent thinking. Together these studies showed that preference-inconsistent recommendations can foster social navigation and elaboration. In conclusion, future research and practical implications are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:46Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, it is a delicate compromise between taking the ""freedom from"" (i.e., constraining the learners' efforts to self-regulate their learning) and providing the ""freedom to"" learners (i.e., enabling them to collaborate on a higher level) when implementing CSCL scripts. The study reported here aimed to answer the question whether adaptable scripting would be an effective approach to realize flexibility in scripted CSCL. 54 university students participated in this study which compared three experimental conditions (unscripted CSCL, CSCL with a non-adaptable script, CSCL with an adaptable script). Results showed that the adaptable script improved individual knowledge and skill acquisition compared to the other two conditions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:46Z (GMT).

Data from a four-week field study with 129 ninth-grade students in three conditions (no script, continuous script and faded script) were analyzed. Findings indicate positive effects of both scripts compared to unsupported collaboration on the practice of the strategy. Learners' own, but not their learning partners' practice of the strategy predicted their development of online search skills. These results indicate that neither mere exposure to the script nor observation of learning partners performing the strategy explain the effects of scripts on learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:46Z (GMT).

In continuation with this line of investigation, this paper presents an experiment that measures the separate and joint effects of the nature and style of automatically generated interventions. We investigate aspects of designing intervention prompts from two different angles: first in terms of the addition of socially oriented turns over and above the instructional turns required to keep the students on track, and second in terms of the style of presentation of the tutor's instructional turns. We see positive effects of both manipulations, but on different outcome metrics. Thus, we conclude that the two directions can be productively combined into a single socially enhanced feedback approach, which contributes to the literature on dynamic forms of support for collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:47Z (GMT).

In an empirical study (N = 81) we varied the degree of an argumentative script (low vs. medium vs. high) and examined the effects on processes and outcomes of argumentative knowledge construction. Our results show positive effects of the medium and high degree of scripting on argumentative knowledge construction. We found negative effects of the medium and high degree of scripting on motivation, however, but low motivation did not negatively interfere with knowledge acquisition. Furthermore, our reframing of over-scripting allowed us to differentiate between under-scripting, over-scripting and, finally, malfunctional scripts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:47Z (GMT).

To examine discourse types, all audio-recorded verbal data of the three groups of secondary students is transcribed, coded and analysed with respect to two key dimensions in the knowledge construction process, namely, the epistemic and the social. Tasks were categorized largely into performative and knowledge-generative. Analysis showed that different epistemic activities and the nature of facilitation have a definitive bearing on group discursive moves and more importantly, the presence of a real world context could generate intense knowledge co-construction even for mundane performative tasks. In conclusion, we propose that a three-prong approach (FAT) Facilitation, Activities in-situ, and Technology should be considered to support meaningful collaborative learning practices in mobile learning. Introduction Rapid advancement in information and communications technology has revolutionised the teaching and learning landscape; creating new and exciting possibilities for learning beyond the four walls of the classroom, and thereby, inevitably changing the role of both the learner and the teacher. Seamless learning across context and space is now made possible with the affordances of mobile computing and web applications. Interaction with the real world environment has also given learning, new shades of meaning and intent. In the field of computer- supported collaborative learning (CSCL), whilst there is extensive research and literature on leveraging emerging mobile devices and Web 2.0 technologies to enhance the learning experience in the real-world setting and/ or learning on the move (e.g., Squire &amp; Klopfer, 2007), there remains little empirical research on other equally significant configurations of mobile learning: that is the design configuration of mobile learning environments and the execution path to bring about the desired learning outcomes. Another common pitfall is the focus on the unending possibilities of mobile devices and innovative software applications over the rich affordances of the physical environment in the context of enhancing mobile learning. To examine the design configurations and the affordances of real-world contexts for promoting meaningful collaborative learning experiences, this paper articulates the in situ learning experience of three groups of Secondary One students (ages 12-13) on a geography mobile learning trail. Specifically, we are interested in investigating the intricate relationship among task-design, facilitation and the discourse types in situated small group collaborative learning. This study analyses the content, process and pattern of students' interactional discourse in the knowledge construction process. We believe that a focus on process rather than outcome is pertinent to understanding the design configurations necessary for effective in situ collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:48Z (GMT).

It is found that the GS technology and pedagogical graphic organizers can jointly scaffold students' collaborative vocabulary learning to achieve desired learning outcomes. When equipped with graphic organizers to help students plan and organize their problem solving, GS is transformed from a general tool for enabling seamless interactions to a scaffolded software tool integrated with pedagogical design for supporting specific learning, by problematizing important disciplinary content.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:48Z (GMT).

Yet, to be effective, it needs to be structured appropriately. In a quasi- experimental field study employing a 2x2 design, we investigated the effects of a small-group collaboration script (present vs. absent), two variants of a classroom script (online search activities constantly located on the small group level vs. online search activities alternating between plenary and small group level) and their different combinations on online search competence during an inquiry learning unit on Genetic Engineering. Results indicate that scaffolding on at least one of the two levels (realizing plenary phases or providing a small group script) is necessary to reach higher levels of online search competence. However, combining classroom scripts that alternate between plenary and small-group phases and small- group scripts did not further improve online search competence.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:48Z (GMT).

Using a co-design method, researchers worked with high school teachers to create engaging curriculum activities that provided the context for two studies in math and physics. The activity designs aim to increase the depth of students' conceptual understanding by breaking down learning goals into manageable sections. Students ""tagged"" questions in terms of relevant concepts, analyzed visualizations that captured the collective wisdom of the classroom community, critiqued results, and negotiated a shared understanding of domain-specific principles. Twenty-one mathematics students from grades ten and eleven participated in the first study; thirty-two grade twelve physics students participated in the second. Results showed improvements in problem-solving (in the second study), as well as improved tagging proximity to an expert model (in both studies). Issues with collaboration scripts used in the smart classroom are also discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Natural Language Processing technologies may allow automating the analysis. However, the state-of-the-art in machine learning and text mining approaches yields models that do not transfer well between corpora related to different topics. Also segmenting is a necessary step, but frequently, trained models are very sensitive to the particulars of the segmentation that was used when the model was trained. Therefore, in prior published research on text classification in a CSCL context, the data has been segmented by hand. We discuss work towards overcoming these challenges. We present a framework for developing coding schemes optimized for automatic segmentation and topic independent coding that builds on this segmentation. Our results show that our coding scheme can be fully automated by using a tool called SIDE. Finally, we discuss how fully automated analysis can enable context-sensitive support for collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A major objective regards the development and use of analysis tools that are simultaneously appropriate for conducting meaningful evaluations of collaborative processes and efficient for practical use. This article adopts an innovative approach to CSCL analysis, involving the use of a rating scheme for the assessment of collaboration quality in several of its core dimensions. It involves appropriately trained evaluators that assign ratings on significant aspects of collaboration. Based on statistical analyses of ratings of 228 collaborating dyads working synchronously on a computer science problem-solving task, it reports and interprets interesting findings concerning general trends of collaborative practice, associations between dimensions of collaboration quality, and the way they relate to the quality of the problem's solution.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:49Z (GMT).

The knowledge creation approach to learning, which places collaborative creation of knowledge objects at its core, served as a guide for the pedagogical design, which includes specifications of the collaborative activities and tools utilized. We collected different types of data. Analyses followed three lines of investigation: analysis of group interactions, of concepts and ideas uptake, and of object co-construction and development. Findings show various degrees of idea sharing and of co-elaboration of object iterations. These findings assist us in formulating recommendations for future research and pedagogical design, especially with regard to pedagogical settings, and technological support for object co-construction and co-elaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:51Z (GMT).

From a study of exchanges between teachers on Web forums we examine two facets of knowledge exchange, usual teaching practices and problem solving, and how they can be managed on a unique web platform. We use a task/method paradigm for knowledge elicitation about usual teaching practices, driven by the exchanges between teachers and capitalized into individual memories. For problem solving we use an IBIS-like approach (problem, solution, argument) and REX-like cards to structure the problem and solution description. The important problem of knowledge evaluation is treated with a three-level evaluation (opinion, usefulness and difficulty). The teacher's profile and its central role in connecting teachers is described. For knowledge classification, because a consensus is difficult in this domain, we propose a mixed approach between structured classification techniques (taxonomies) and unstructured techniques (folksonomies).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:52Z (GMT).

This study examines how the two teachers engaged in increasingly sophisticated classroom design over time, and how their students moved towards more collective work and productive discourse. Obstacles and opportunities were identified as the researcher worked with the teachers to emphasize principle-based and collective design. Analyses indicated that, over time, students participated more in Knowledge Forum in terms of community awareness and connectedness, and moved more from knowledge-sharing to explanatory knowledge-building discourse. Analyses of students' posttest scores on science tests indicated that students' Knowledge Forum participation was positively correlated with domain understanding. Examining new teachers' shifts in classroom designs and their students' changes towards explanatory discourse may have implications for identifying the developmental trajectories of knowledge-building dynamics and practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:52Z (GMT).

We use the Learning to Notice framework (van Es &amp; Sherin, 2008) to characterize the kinds of activity that occurred when teachers used the tools in a team meeting. Then, we show how theses uses suggest ways that research on and uses of student activity representations may need to be sensitive to how contexts of implementation shape the consumption and use of those representations. Objective Researchers in CSCL, educational data mining, games for learning, CSCW, and HCI more broadly are working to develop manual and automatic techniques for characterizing and classifying patterns, including patterns over time, in users' collaborative and individual interactions with computer-based media (Reimann, 2009). Suthers and colleagues are developing a methodology, and supporting tools, for analyzing logs of online activity in order to discover patterns in uses of on-screen representations that span multiple participants (Suthers et al., 2010; Medina &amp; Suthers, 2008). Shute et al. (2009) describes how the play of educational games may be scrutinized to create psychometrically valid assessments of learning and understanding that may be embedded in-game. Bit by bit, CSCL and its cognate fields are developing the methodological tools to produce precisely the kind of accounts of student activity that could support breakthroughs in the responsiveness of instructional environments (Fullan et al., 2006). But very few efforts have been made to actually construct systems that would assist teachers in understanding their students' activity and learning in CSCL environments. Rare exceptions include Feng and Heffernan (2006)'s ASSISTment project, which explores how students' interactions with an intelligent tutoring system may be summarized in order to help teachers to know what students know and Summary Street, which provides teachers and students with feedback about the quality of students' text comprehension and summary writing (Wade-Stein &amp; Kintsch, 2004). Because of this, very little progress has been made toward figuring out how practitioners (teachers or students) will use computer-generated accounts of student activity (and what the challenges to doing so will be) once the difficult methodological challenges of constructing them have been sufficiently overcome. We do not believe that research into the application of representations of student activity and learning to improving teaching must wait until methods for generating valid and reliable accounts of activity and learning are established. Instead, we propose that CSCL should deepen its inquiry into how representations of students' activity may be used in schools even as it figures out how to create those representations. Indeed, research on how such accounts could be used, including the diverse ways in which different teachers might interpret different representations or in which different backgrounds or classroom contexts might shape their interpretation may be quite valuable in shaping the learning analytic program by helping researchers within it to focus their efforts on techniques that might have the largest impact on practice. This paper describes the beginnings of an attempt to do just that. We describe a student activity visualization that we constructed to provide a context for ethnomethodological inquiry -- a design-based breach experiment (Crabtree et al, 2004) -- into how teachers might think and communicate about student thinking when they have tools that give them better access to student activity. We describe our results in two parts: first, we use the Learning to Notice framework (van Es &amp; Sherin, 2008) to establish whether our tool provides enough stimulus to the existing context of work to make activity occur that is consistent with a leading theory of teacher learning. Then, we show how the uses of our tool in teachers' collaborative practice suggest ways that research on student activity analysis representation construction and uses of new representations in practice may need to be sensitive to how contexts of implementation shape the consumption and use of those representations. Theoretical Framework Teaching is a socially complex dynamic of data-rich interactions between teachers, students, and content, mediated by classroom materials. What teachers choose to focus on with respect to their instruction, their classroom environment, and student understanding has a powerful influence on what they understand about their classrooms (Sherin &amp; van Es, 2003). Teacher noticing is simultaneously a process of directing attention to certain features of instruction as well as a sense-making activity that connects what one notices to larger principles of action. Collaborative practices that improve teachers' capacity to notice student thinking in classroom activity can also develop common professional vision (Goodwin, 1992) amongst teams of teachers (an important ingredient in improving instruction in schools) as well as make teaching practices more public","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:52Z (GMT).

One method is to distribute experienced teachers' cultivated practices as examples, but good ways of presenting the essential aspects of these exemplary practices should be developed. The study examined how two experienced primary teachers constructed technology-enhanced collaborative learning units in order to document these examples as training materials. The first case was an inquiry project in biology; the second case focused on the virtual publishing of a Web journal. The Pedagogical Infrastructure Framework, including technical, social, epistemological and cognitive components, was applied in the analysis. The results revealed that experienced teachers planned long-term, goal-oriented processes consisting of well- organized activities where various elements of the pedagogical infrastructure were coherently integrated, which provided pupils with the possibility to practice challenging technical and academic skills in a meaningful context. Based on the analysis, ideas for the further development of teacher training materials are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:53Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Our experiments revealed design features that reduce the global orchestration load. According to our studies in vocational schools, paper-based interfaces have the potential of making educational workflows tangible, i.e. both visible and manipulable. Our studies in university classes converge on minimalism: they reveal the effectiveness o tools that make visible what is invisible but do not analyze, predict or decide for teachers. These studies revealed a third circle of usability. The first circle concerns individual usability (HCI). The second circle is about design for teams (CSCL/CSCW). The third circle raises design choices that impart visibility, reification and minimalism on classroom orchestration. The fact that a CSCL environment allows or not students to look at what the next team is doing (e.g. tabletops versus desktops) illustrates the third circle issues that are important for orchestration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:53Z (GMT).

This kind of improvisatory adaptation of teaching, however, is seldom seen in everyday classroom practice of CSCL. This paper describes two independent research projects that aim to influence authentic classroom practices to promote this kind of teaching using the same collaborative learning tool, Group Scribbles. Evidence from both projects shows that merely providing technologies that support this adaptation is not enough to provoke the change and that exposing teachers to good uses of the tool (in the form of pedagogical patterns) also has limited success. Both projects highlight the difficulty for practitioners to bridge the gap between de-contextualized advice and contextualized classroom situations. We propose the use of more atomic, actionable moves to help teachers orchestrate technology to support deeper collaborative knowledge building.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:54Z (GMT).

Curriculum reform initiatives expect that development will take place at least in part through teacher collaboration and sharing of curriculum resources through digital repositories. However, curriculum artifacts have not so far proved to be an effective medium for teacher collaboration. This paper argues that the teaching profession suffers from not having a shared professional language to describe and communicate their design ideas, and demonstrates that the provision of a design language and format that highlights the multilevel, multi-faceted aspects of a design helps to scaffold teacher discourse to deeper pedagogical discussions. On the basis of the findings from a cross-cultural collaboration, we set out the implications for computer-supported collaborative learning for teachers, to enable more effective teacher learning and collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:54Z (GMT).

CSCL groups--such as virtual math teams--have to co-construct their shared world with extra effort. A case study of building shared understanding online illustrates these aspects: Asking each other questions is one common way of aligning perceptions. Literally looking at the same aspect of something as someone else helps us to see what each other means. The co-constructed shared world has social and temporal as well as objective dimensions. This virtual world grounds communicative, interpersonal, and task-related activities for online groups, making possible group cognition that exceeds the limits of the individual cognition of the group members.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:54Z (GMT).

Building on the knowledge base we developed in a 2-year research project involving both learning scientists and economists, we first briefly review some of the challenges in establishing strong links from educational innovations to economic impacts. We postulate that the promise of linking CSCL to economic concerns requires shifting attention from goals of efficiency to goals that balance efficiency and innovation yet the outcomes most researchers seek and measure still focus too much on efficiency. To further catalyze discussion, we suggest more deeply theorizing innovation and developing assessments that are sensitive to cognitive diversity. We offer a definition of innovation tasks as those that require student to adapt resources and expertise to define and solve challenging problems for the benefit of others.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:55Z (GMT).

This paper offers a detailed perspective on how teachers developed PCK with their engagement in lesson planning and enactment of a project-based technology-enhanced lesson in relationship to their actions in the class. The study includes two specific interventions designed to enhance teachers' development of PCK: (1) scaffolded reflection, and (2) peer-exchange. The findings presented in this paper focus on the impact of the peer exchange intervention, which was achieved through an online community, combined with face-to-face meetings. Results demonstrate a positive impact of such exchanges on the quality of teachers' lesson designs and enactments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:56Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Based on the procedures of grounded theory (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967), we examined notes that grade 4 students entered into an online discourse environment (Knowledge Forum) and developed the following empirically grounded list of contributor roles: asking thought-provoking questions, theorizing, experimenting, working with evidence, creating syntheses and analogies, and supporting discussion. Regression analysis was performed to examine whether any of these roles can predict various measures of individual knowledge advancement. The analysis revealed two significant predictors: theorizing and working with evidence. Theorizing accounts for variation in scientificness of students' ideas as well as knowledge test scores; working with evidence predicts epistemic complexity of students' portfolios. These results inform next steps in creating classroom interventions and technology tools for collaborative knowledge creation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:14:56Z (GMT).

Twenty-one students were divided into two groups and assigned rotating roles for eight one-week asynchronous online discussions. The KC contributions of all 252 posts in the discussion were coded using a five phase scheme; then statistical discourse analysis was applied to identify segments of discussion characterized by particular aspects of KC and ""pivotal posts""--those posts which initiated new segments of discussion. Finally, the influences of assigned student roles on pivotal posts and KC were modeled. The results indicate that most online discussions had a single pivotal post separating the discussion into two distinct segments: the first dominated by a lower KC phase; the second dominated by a higher KC phase. The pivotal posts that initiated later segments were often contributed mid-discussion by students playing one of two summarizing roles (Synthesizer and Wrapper).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:15:02Z (GMT).

Knowledge advancement was evaluated based on student portfolio notes focusing on the depth and breadth of their optical understanding. Correlations found between the measures of social interaction, content, and lexical usage in the discourse and the depth and breadth of student understanding help to empirically justify a set of online discourse measures that are sensitive to knowledge productivity. The results suggest a framework to inform the selection, creation, and integrated use of online discourse measures in research as well as design of automated assessment tools embedded in collaborative learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:15:09Z (GMT).

We analyzed the episodes of the dynamic group discussion by reconsidering the meaning-making of each posting in order to gain a full contextual understanding of how collective knowledge developed. The results identified three critical moments: ""confusion and hesitation"", ""from stick around to move forward"" and ""making justification and breaking through"". Unlike using the single posting or adjacent pairs of postings as the unit of analysis, this study claims that linking backwards to earlier turns is as important as linking forwards to later turns for discovering a complete picture of how online group members co-construct knowledge. The nuance of dealing with the time dimension across different approaches in CSCL is also discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:15:16Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Using cluster analysis of learners' click-stream data from an online discussion forum, this study identified three patterns of behaviors that differentiate between learners: Superficial Listeners, Intermittent Talkers; Concentrated Listeners, Integrated Talkers; and Broad Listeners, Reflective Talkers. Clusters differed in the amount of time spent listening, number of posts attended to, number and length of their sessions, and number of own posts contributed and reviewed. Clusters did not differ in percentage of posts scanned (vs. read), time to compose posts, length of posts made, or final course grades. Results are compared to interaction styles found for other online tools and implications for practice and future research are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:15:26Z (GMT).

Furthermore, little is known about what and how students learn through the digital technologies that are increasingly being used in these non-school settings. Through an experimental design, this study compared four conditions for learning science concepts with augmented reality technologies in a science museum. Using knowledge-building scaffolds known to be successful in formal classrooms, we hypothesized that students would show greater cognitive gains and higher order inquiry skills than when scaffolds were not used. Through the use of digital augmentations, the study also provided information about how such technologies impact learning in informal environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:15:31Z (GMT).

The lesson unit consisted of 11 problems whose answers were to be predicted and discussed one at a time. All 21 students in the class successfully learned the target concept. Our analysis revealed that they started by confirming their rudimentary ideas taken from daily experiences, and then gradually developed theory- like concepts by repeatedly discussing their predictions to be confirmed with experiments. Toward the end of the unit, individual students could express their understanding in their own words, indicating that they successfully integrated their folk knowledge with scientific thinking. Further analysis of the dialogue contents indicated that some small-group discussions were effectively monitored and utilized by the rest of the class, to assure achievement of the entire class.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T02:15:46Z (GMT).
