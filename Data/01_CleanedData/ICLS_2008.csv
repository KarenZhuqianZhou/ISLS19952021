We suggest an alternative metaphor, where students are viewed as longstanding members of an overlapping yet different culture than that represented by the instructional setting. This metaphor allows for sensitivity to learning difficulties that arise when students' contextualization of the milieu is dominated by the other cultural viewpoint. We suggest the concept of fertile zones of cultural encounter as a pedagogical approach to bridging the gap between cultures by designing interventions appreciated by members of both cultures, while also encouraging students to engage in the practices of the professional culture. We demonstrate the usefulness of such conceptualization in two school subjects: computer science and history.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:28Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Drawing upon sociocultural perspectives on learning and critical ethnographic research methods, we examine students' changing participation within middle school learning science. Our findings reveal the importance of ""place"" in how and why these youth pursue science learning. We argue that one way in which place shapes their learning is in how the youth take up science as both a context and a tool for change. We look at two interrelated kinds of changes within the classroom: crafting new forms of participation and new points on entry into the science learning community, and redefining the purpose of science activity. We also argue these instantiations of place in learning serve to connect the worlds of youth with the worlds of school science.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:28Z (GMT).

Using dynamic multilevel analysis (DMA) and a structural equation model (SEM), this study analyzed 131 messages of 47 participants across seven topics in the mathematics forum of a university Bulletin Board System (BBS) Website. Results showed that a disagreement or contribution in the previous message yielded more disagreements and social cue displays in the current message. Unlike face-to-face discussions, online discussion messages that disagreed with a previous message elicited more responses. Together, these results suggest that teachers can use and manage online discussions to promote critical thinking, facilitate discussion of controversial topics, and reduce status effects.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:29Z (GMT).

In contrast, the likelihood of a CC was lower after a group member disagreed rudely or agreed. Meanwhile, group-level properties (racial diversity, gender diversity, and degree of status differences) did not significantly affect the likelihood of a CC. A CC was more likely after a justification in successful groups than in unsuccessful groups. CCs did not occur uniformly, as some time periods had many CCs while others had few CCs.

However, empirical evidence of these benefits is lacking. In line with a study on the use of a mobile phone during driving (Hunton &amp; Rose, 2005), this contribution addresses the influence of a second task while learning from an iPod. Two studies are reported in which two groups of students were compared. The control group learnt material from an iPod while sitting at a desk, and the experimental group learnt material from an iPod while riding on a exercise bike. Results reveal in the two studies that the control group outperformed the experimental group, suggesting that the second task interfered with learning. It seems that even though one could say that the two tasks do not use the same part of working memory and need not to be integrated, a split attention effect did occur.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:30Z (GMT).

In particular, this study investigates two possible hypotheses explaining the conflicting results obtained by Ioannides and Vosniadou (2002) and diSessa, Gillespie, and Esterly (2004) about students' understandings of force in Greece and the United States. Ioannides and Vosniadou's study in Greece demonstrated broad consistency in students' understandings of force. diSessa and colleague's quasi-replication in the U.S. demonstrated conflicting results supporting more elemental perspectives. One hypothesis focuses on differences in analytic methods. The other hypothesis focuses on semantic, cultural, or educational differences between the students in the two studies. The findings of this study suggest that differences in analytic methods do result in coding differences but that these relatively small differences would not account for the significant differences between the studies. This study, however, demonstrates significant differences for force meanings and knowledge structure coherence across the countries that might explain a larger percentage of the differences in findings between the studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:30Z (GMT).

Results reveal that students engage in some productive learning strategies promoted in the design of the project, such as learning with visualizations and collaborating with others. Students reported the visualizations to be the most helpful to their learning. The teacher provided the most guidance to students in the form of high-level questions that prompted students to make connections and to monitor their comprehension during days when the students interacted with the visualizations. After completion of the project, students reported engaging in more active and productive strategies for learning and monitoring their understanding of new science material. Implications and plans for further research are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:30Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

While both classes followed the same curriculum, which encouraged disciplinary engagement in the subjects of history and science, the pedagogical stances of the teachers led to some noticeable differences in the ""participatory roles"" that students took up during the course of instruction. However, despite differences in terms of the way students participated in discussions, this study finds that the stratification of students within each classroom in terms of the total amount of participation per student was the same across both rooms. The data point to pervasive patterns of student/student and student/teacher interaction, which confer status (and thus the right to speak) on particular kids.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:31Z (GMT).

How can instructional designers know whether a given diagram will enhance learning? We have developed a framework of three factors that influence the effectiveness of a diagram in a particular learning situation: the learning objective, the design of the visual representation and the cognitive processing of the learner. In a randomized-design study conducted in a college chemistry class, we found that instruction that included diagrams created with this framework led to enhanced performance on open-ended transfer items compared to traditional instruction, particularly for low-performing students. We propose that a concept-based cognitive theory of multimedia learning that includes a conceptual working memory component may explain why the efficacy of diagrams depends heavily on the prior knowledge of the learner as well as the conceptual information available in the representation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:31Z (GMT).

Since teachers' beliefs mediate their practice, characterizing their beliefs about effective science teaching can yield insights about ways to support beginning elementary teachers as they learn to teach science. This longitudinal study follows six elementary teachers in their early years of teaching. Five conceptions of effective science teaching are identified. In addition, though the teachers' beliefs are largely consistent over time--indicating that these are, indeed, central beliefs within their beliefs systems--a move away from reform-oriented practices is identified for most of the teachers in their third year of teaching. Implications for teacher preparation and induction point to the importance of supporting teachers in understanding the rationales behind reforms such as inquiry-oriented science teaching and engaging students in scientific practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:31Z (GMT).

Findings showed that the experimental MR group elicited relations better than the controls (SR), regarding relations' accuracy, descriptive level, and novelty, and regarding number of information sources and diversity of variables used.

In this paper, I use a set of principles for fostering productive engagement to explain how the Middle-school Mathematics through Applications Project (MMAP) got its team of researchers, teachers, and curriculum developers off to a good start. First, MMAP fostered problematizing around MMAP goals by recruiting participants whose goals partially overlapped with MMAP's, and by demonstrating the importance of core goals like equity. Second, the project supported teacher authority by selecting staff already inclined to respect teachers, by showing teachers that their contributions were desired, and by setting expectations that teachers would have the ultimate authority for how curricula would be used. Finally, MMAP fostered accountability by recruiting participants with varied expertise, setting expectations that teachers would change their teaching practices, and encouraging everyone to begin engaging in focused discussions with each other.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:32Z (GMT).

When one is interested in designing experiments that do not just test hypotheses about causal effects but also develop hypotheses about new kinds of causal mechanisms, we claim that it is particularly valuable to use the design-based research practices of iteratively designing new learning ecologies in particular contexts and creating explanatory accounts that coordinate multiple measures. Also, experimentally-inspired practices of comparing theoretically contrasting interventions in parallel and systematically streamlining designs to distinguish between critical and less critical design elements have promise for being usefully adapted within design-based research studies themselves.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:32Z (GMT).

One particular game practice the throwing of projectiles and its social uses and nuances became the focal point of our analyses.

We present a group-level discourse analysis based on cultural-historical activity theory that characterizes the unfolding collaborative learning and knowledge construction processes in context. The application of the mixed- method approach is illustrated in the context of two online graduate courses. The analysis highlights connected sequences of discursive actions that multiple students make to advance shared understanding. The mechanics of the approach offered in this paper can be used as an analytic and transformative tool for enhancing online learning, research, and instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:33Z (GMT).

The model has helped each of us to account for gaps between intended and enacted sequences in relation to these artifacts. In particular, instrumental genesis provides a mechanism for differentiating between the designer's arc of intentionality and the student's learning trajectory, two vectors that may be tacitly aligned for historically evolved learning materials but at variance for recently created materials. Characteristic of our case studies--a networked-classroom design for functions and a mixed-media design for probability--are breakdowns in which students' behavior deviated either from the designer's intention or from classic models of constructivist design. In both cases, the breakdowns were valuable in that they occasioned refinement of our theories and designs.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:34Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Issues of assessment are extremely important for measuring the quality of learning and teaching. Typical assessments tend to tell us what students have learned in the past but not necessarily how prepared they are to learn in the future. With this problem in mind, we have begun research on how students are able to use resources (technology-based access to relevant information, social networks, simulations) in order to learn to solve problems. Our goal is to provide more valid measures of students' existing strengths as well as skills and knowledge that they need to learn. Our assessments are designed to be both formative and summative.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:34Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A positioning system with three different settings was prototyped (Private, Anonymous or Public). It was predicted that students voting publicly would be less inclined to express changes in their views, and that they would tend to conform to the class' overall position more than students voting either anonymously or privately. Three groups of students (N=55) taking A Level General Studies took part in debates and voted in one of the three conditions. Results supported both hypotheses and suggest that anonymity and privacy play a crucial role in encouraging students to express individual and authentic positions. The implications of these results for technology mediated voting systems are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:34Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This paper reports on the nature of the different enactments of two teachers using the same tools. Although both classrooms showed similar learning gains, Interactions Analyses (IA) found differences between the enactments in two main areas; (1) providing opportunities for inquiry and language used to communicate and (2) teacher interpretation of the computer model. These findings suggest that how tools are appropriated is greatly influenced by teacher beliefs and classroom culture and that there may be multiple paths to productive use of such tools.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:35Z (GMT).

We contest this work in two ways: (1) it reflects a misunderstanding of expert knowledge, and (2) reasoning by experts and novices often traverses ontological categories in both profes- sional and everyday contexts. We cite examples from research articles as well as classroom discussions to illustrate that experts as well as novices hop across ontological boundaries to make sense of physical phenomenon. This suggests a dynamic context-dependent model of a person's ontological view. To promote one ontological description in physics instruction, as suggested by Slotta and Chi, could suppress an essential skill for the development of exper- tise.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:35Z (GMT).

One possibility for supporting productive conversations between collaborators is to encourage pairs of students to provide explanations for their problem-solving steps. To test this possibility, we contrasted individuals who were instructed to self-explain problem-solving steps with dyads who were instructed to jointly explain problem-solving steps in the context of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). The results suggest that collaboratively developed explanations prompted students to remediate their errors in dialog, as opposed to relying on the ITS for assistance, which is provided in the form of on-demand hints.

While both groups were engaged in the task of collaborative writing, the CSCL group was supported by a web-based software Knowledge Forum whereas the control group created their articles via paper and pencil. During the research, observation notes were taken and students were interviewed. The results showed that students who worked with Knowledge Forum had significant gains in their writing performance compared with the control group. In addition, the students in Knowledge Forum were more motivated to write than the other group. The study demonstrates that CSCL augments collaborative learning and makes individuals' thinking visible via its technological affordances.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:36Z (GMT).

This is especially problematic for designers of inquiry-based learning environments that make ambitious demands on readers. We report on our efforts to provide targeted strategic supports for struggling adolescent readers in science classrooms. Environmental science and biology high school students learned to use tools designed to foster three specific metacognitive skills: recognizing text structure, reflecting on content, and representing the gist of a text in a summary. During one school year, students had regular opportunities to use these strategies in class. Participants completed one tool use assessment at the end of the school year in which they used the tools during reading of a science text. Students then answered science comprehension questions about the text. Tool proficiency was correlated with both reading and science achievement. Tool proficiency also predicted science achievement when controlling for on-entry reading ability. The implications for science instruction are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We consider tool support for manual coding, automatic coding by learning algorithms, and derive at a socio-technical approach in which human coders and learning algorithms together address the coding task. Given that a literature study suggests researchers devise, adapt and refine a wide variety of coding schemes, a categorization support system should handle and accommodate user defined coding schemes. Based on these ideas a prototype of the ChatIC tool was developed and evaluated with three coding schemes. For two coding schemes a sufficient inter-rater agreement between a human coder and the learning algorithms was reached.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:37Z (GMT).

First, they should support situative embodiment in academic knowledge, where personally meaningful activities and coherent narratives foster collective engagement. Second, they should offer multiple levels and forms of meaningful assessment and the opportunity to succeed, fail, and try again. Third, they should provide useful feedback that is used to enhance participation, learning, and curricula. These principles were developed in three annual design-based refinements of a 15- hour ecological sciences gaming curriculum in nine upper elementary classes. Across years, the situative embodiment afforded by the curriculum was refined with informal assessment, and innovative virtual formative feedback was incorporated around a key curricular activity. Results across years revealed incremental improvements in participation, understanding of key concepts, and achievement of targeted standards. The ultimate gains in understanding and achievement were larger than those in comparison classrooms that used a conventional text-based curriculum covering the same concepts and standards.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:37Z (GMT).

To examine the influence of concept mapping on learning from texts, we varied the support strategies. Eighty students either learned by constructing concept maps on their own, by correcting an incorrect worked-out map, or by studying a correct worked-out map. A control group did not engage in any follow-up activity for learning from text. As expected, learners profited most from studying the correct worked-out map. Students who corrected an incorrect worked-out map did not have a better learning result than students who generated concept maps on their own or the control group. On the contrary, they produced many false conclusions in the comprehension test.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Little attention has been directed to the teaching of people knowledge about scientists, i.e. knowledge of the subject (or the observer) who creates knowledge. This study explores the nature of this people knowledge and its possible effects on science learning. There are two types of people knowledge identified through this study: breadth-oriented people knowledge (BPK) and depth-oriented people knowledge (DPK). BPK profiles scientists' scientific achievements across life whereas DPK describes scientists' intellectual struggle in relation to their theory building. The findings indicate that the two types of people knowledge are fundamentally different in nature and it is only DPK that is beneficial to science learning (e.g., deepening students' understanding of scientific theories and making science learning environments more humanly interesting).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:37Z (GMT).

Two small groups of Finnish students (N=46) from different universities attended a national virtual course concerning a specific topic in the history of science. The course assignment consisted of participating into seven different discussion topics using Optima, an asynchronous learning environment. The discussions were used to examine communication networks during the course. Social network analysis techniques were used to explore communication networks and changes in these networks at structural and dyadic levels in four discrete time points with the effects of degree, reciprocity, transitivity and 3-cycles modeled by using the conditional method of moments. The results of the study suggest that during a virtual course the participants tend to form subgroups and hierarchical structures as in the same way as any other social community.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:38Z (GMT).

In this paper we present a theoretical investigation of the use of pen-based computing in large lectures (&gt;150 students). In particular, through this case study we examined how the combined use of Tablet PCs and the interactive software DyKnow creates a learning environment that is conducive to student participation and learning. We argue that these technologies enable participation by facilitating creation, sharing, recording, and reflecting of representations. Although the ideas presented in this paper are primarily theoretical, we do find supporting evidence through in-class (N=100 to 250) and online surveys (N = 525) of engineering freshmen at Virginia Tech.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:39Z (GMT).

Also, using computers in math education contributes to students' motivation and engagement. This paper reports on a study focused on the contribution of playing so-called ""Th!nklets"" on doing and learning mathematics.

We observed and recorded players' conversations and contestations about Whypox in an after school gaming club. We found that club members' argumentation involved the use of warrants, rebuttals, and data as found in other studies of everyday argumentation. Players also developed different theories, some unwarranted, about the causes and spread of Whypox, and used the epidemic to position themselves as insiders. In our discussion, we address ways in which virtual epidemics connect to on-going research on everyday argumentation and provide starting points for students' learning about infectious diseases.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:39Z (GMT).

Since the goal of the investigation is to engineer and study coaching as an innovative form of assisting learning within the prevailing educational context, model development and validation activities were funded on a design- based research approach. These activities include 1.) a review of currently available scientific literature in design research and education, and 2.) a series of four formative research studies.

Instructional efforts have concentrated on supporting students' development of collaborative agency knowing how to collaborate in small groups. Much less emphasis has been placed on students' collective agency that would involve participation in large groups prominent in today's social networking sites and online cultures. Here we use our observations in an urban community technology center where groups of 30- 40 youth self-organized their dance performances called Krumping and/or Clowning to inspire rethinking from collaborative to collective agency in learning. Our analysis is based on four years of ethnographic field work that helped us articulate different aspects of activity structures that promote collective agency, distributed leadership, and the role of performance. We use these findings to reflect on our conceptions of learning and the design of learning technologies and environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:40Z (GMT).

To counter this, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Research Council, and the National Science Teachers Association have all called for a stronger emphasis on having students perform scientific inquiry in the classroom. Yet this has proven challenging to do. How can schools replicate authentic science experiences in the classroom? This paper reports on the benefits of using Multi-user Virtual Environments to create authentic science experiences for middle-school students that allow them to engage in the processes of scientists. Our research indicates that low self-efficacy students and those with poor initial knowledge do as well as those with average self-efficacy and better than those learning with more traditional inquiry pedagogies. High self-efficacy students, however, do better with the traditional inquiry methods.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:40Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Applying cognitive load theory, the limitations of the working memory capacity at the individual level were considered an important reason to assign complex learning tasks to groups rather than to individuals. It was hypothesized that groups will have more processing capacity available for relating the information elements to each other and by doing so for constructing higher quality cognitive schemata than individuals if the high cognitive load imposed by complex learning tasks could be shared among group members. In contrast, it was expected that individuals who learn from carrying out the same complex tasks would need all available processing capacity for remembering the interrelated information elements, and, consequently, would not be able to allocate resources to working with them. This interaction hypothesis was confirmed by the data on efficiency of retention and transfer test performance; there was a favorable relationship between mental effort and retention test performance for the individual learners as opposed to a favorable relationship between transfer test performance and mental effort for the students who learned in groups.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:41Z (GMT).

For internal scripts, it is not clear whether they have identical effects on collaborative argumentation processes in oral vs. written discussions. We empirically investigated the effects of two differently structured external scripts on the structural quality of written and oral arguments produced in dyads with either low or high structured internal scripts. External scripts were presented in a written mode at specific instances in a web-based inquiry learning environment. Results indicate that the high structured external script strongly improved the structural quality of the written arguments, but had hardly any effects on orally produced arguments, which were instead more strongly influenced by the learners' internal scripts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:41Z (GMT).

Participants were 40 experimental and 39 comparison students experiencing knowledge building and traditional instruction respectively. Students engaging in knowledge building posed questions, generated theories and hypothesis, constructed explanations, and revised their theories mediated by Knowledge Forum. Various measures were collected at pre and posttests including epistemological beliefs, conceptual- change questions and online discourse and reflection. Results indicated that experimental students made more gains than comparison students on both conceptual and epistemological measures. Epistemological beliefs and knowledge-building reflection were correlated with science learning; regression analyses indicated that knowledge-building reflection and inquiry contributed to conceptual change over and above prior knowledge and epistemological beliefs. Implications of knowledge building for developing epistemological beliefs and meta- conceptual awareness for conceptual change are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:41Z (GMT).

The evolution of the student's thinking from purposeful guessing and checking to an algebraic algorithm illustrates that this activity structure can potentially offer a context in which the meaningful development of the fundamental concepts of variable, function, and rate of change can be engaged.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:41Z (GMT).

We propose that collaborative scientific conceptual change occurs when learners co-construct new knowledge and make a shift from their previous ways of thinking towards the scientific ways of thinking that scientists use to explain phenomena. We report preliminary results of a classroom study exploring how students used the simulations to develop collaborative discourse and applied epistemic practices to achieve conceptual change. The results imply that this new theoretical framework is effective to study conceptual change and the simulation environment may mediate the development of successful collaborative interactions (including collaborative discourse and epistemic practices) that lead to conceptual change.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:42Z (GMT).

The special focus was to develop methodological tools for studying the complex nature of learning embedded in a specific context. The study revealed three different context types that were built through the students' discourse. The students' prior knowledge (socio-cultural context) as well as local context, for example earlier discussion with the teacher, served as main resources which the students drew on in their immediate context. In the immediate context, a co-text, such as a written text or an earlier discussion, made up the complete shared context for reasoning and enabled collaborating in the task. The study demonstrated how the discourse both reflected and constructed the context in which it was used.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this paper we examine the role of argumentation and of explanation development in dyadic dialogues and their relation to consequential individual conceptual change. Two quantitative dialogue coding schemes were developed with different granularity: The first assessed the interlocutors' dialog moves during the discussion that pertained to argumentation and explanation development. The second scheme characterized the dialogue as a whole on a number of social and socio-cognitive dimensions. The results emphasized the critical role of engagement in dialectical argumentation for conceptual change, whereas explanation development and validation was not related to learning gains. This finding may explain why instructional interventions are too often insufficient to uproot robust misconceptions. The methodological implications for the study of conceptual change, as well as the practical implications for designing for productive argumentation are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:42Z (GMT).

Three groups were compared who received different but equivalent forms of instruction in learning a topic in economics. One group received an animation presentation with integrated text and diagrams, a second group received a static diagram presentation with integrated text and diagrams, and the third group received a static diagram presentation with non-integrated text and diagrams in a classical split-attention design. Results indicated that the animated design was superior to the static integrated design only on test questions that closely resembled the presented information. No other significant group differences were identified. Furthermore a battery of self-rating measures of cognitive load and motivational items indicated that test performance was predicted by motivation and concentration levels, rather than by mental effort or task difficulty.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:42Z (GMT).

In 2006, I managed the design and piloting of a multilingual literacy learning software for youth and adults in rural South Africa. Drawing from observations of and informal interviews with twenty-six learners who piloted the software, I propose that the software provided the learners with opportunities to reassess not only important self-understandings as learners of basic literacy skills, but also speakers of certain languages and in general, certain kinds of people. The findings, analyzed within the framework of semiotic ideology, support a broader proposition that literacy programs, and the technologies used in them, can serve as forcible mediators of people's understandings of what languages, signs and sociocultural identifications are.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:43:43Z (GMT).

Then we carried out design experiments in which we developed learning opportunities for particular samples of employees. These learning opportunities included technology-enhanced boundary objects (TEBOs) computer tools that were reconfigurations of symbolic mathematical artefacts that employees use at work but where the underlying mathematical models are mostly unknown and generally poorly understood.

Using these technological tools students are able to ask ""what if"" scenarios and evaluate the impact of redesigning the green space around their school.

Our second aim was to develop an enriched analytic framework that can account for the context, the content and the purpose of the discourse moves identified, arguing for a shift of attention in research toward the process of deciding which discourse move to use, rather than solely their description. We analyzed a total of 930 minutes of whole-class conversations facilitated by an experienced science teacher over two years of elementary science lessons. The findings revealed a repertoire of discourse moves that the teacher chose from during instruction based on the context and the epistemological properties of the student discourse content, supporting our contention for the need of a framework that can describe the nature of those choices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:32Z (GMT).

Through RCKB, students also have opportunities to learn and articulate their understanding in a deeper way than traditional classroom lessons. We describe a research project in which together with teachers, we initiated lesson activities that enact RCKB for science lessons. Towards that goal, we envisaged 10 principles for RCKB in the design of lessons, and worked with teachers to co-design lesson plans and apply these principles. Reporting on our initial pilot study, we document some effects of our intervention package in terms of traditional and non-traditional assessments of learning gains. We started with 6 weeks of initiation activities (a.k.a. ""Paper Scribbles"" or PS sessions) in the classroom using sticky paper notes, which was followed by another 10 weeks of activities in a school computer laboratory with the use of the Group Scribbles (GS) software technology. We share our lessons learned in this study, discuss implications for socio-technical instructional design of successful rapid knowledge building activities in the classroom, and suggest avenues for improvement and further research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:33Z (GMT).

A learning journal is a written explication of one's own learning processes and outcomes after a lecture or seminar session. To fully exploit the potential of journal writing, instructional support is required. Experimental studies showed that prompts are effective in optimizing journal writing. To investigate the long-term effects of prompts, we conducted a longitudinal study. Students (N = 50) wrote journal entries about weekly seminar sessions over a whole term. The experimental group received cognitive and metacognitive prompts for their writing. The control group received a non-specific instruction without prompts. The prompts proved to be effective in the short term. However, in the long term, they had negative effects on (1) learning strategies elicited in the journals, (2) learning success and (3) students' writing motivation. In order to avoid such pitfalls of over-prompting, a gradual fading of the prompts might offer a solution.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:33Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Participants studied a passage on fever mechanisms. They entered a virtual reality (VR) environment and met an embodied agent. The participant either read aloud or silently, scripted questions on the fever passage. In the avatar-aloud and avatar-silent conditions, participants were told that the virtual representation was controlled by a person. The agent condition was told that the virtual representation was a computer program. All interactions within VR were held constant, but the avatar conditions exhibited better learning, more attention, and higher arousal. Further results suggest that this was not due to social belief per se, but rather in the belief of taking a socially relevant action.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:34Z (GMT).

With the strong increase of the ageing population in Western societies the number of active older adults willing to learn is growing. Furthermore, due to the increase of ICT older adults will be more and more confronted with multimedia applications that are not tailored to this specific user group and might therefore not be as efficient as they could be. A design that combines adjustments towards the physical decline and adapts cognitive load theory to minimise cognitive overload embedded in an authentic context provides a fruitful basis for learning environments addressing older adults. However, situated learning approaches vary widely in the support given to the learner and the aim is to establish a framework that enables instructional designers to administer the appropriate amount of support for the special abilities and needs of older adults.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:34Z (GMT).

We describe the emergence of the use and effect of this technical artefact by building on Rabardel's (1995) concept of instrumental genesis. From this perspective, a tool or instrument is seen as a mixed functional unit composed of an artefact and a utilisation scheme. We view tool appropriation as a constructive utilisation of the artefact. In case of collaborative tool use this utilisation has to be coordinated. We examine tool appropriation in a collaborative setting as development over three stages. In order to construct their project plan the students had to arrive at a shared representational format. We hypothesized that they would make certain choices during a stage of personal utilisation, and would then coordinate these choices to arrive at a shared convention of use. Our analysis illustrates a transition from mastery to collective utilisation of the tool.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:34Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We have studied how the exclusionary ties and friendship ties are distributed among first grade pupils in the classroom. The basic question was whether girls' and boys' networks are different from each other in regards to the density and centrality of the ties. Further, the size of the class and the effect of the level of multicultural heterogeneity to the tie distribution were studied. All analyses were made at class level. Surprisingly, no remarkable differences were found. The size of the class was found as an important factor influencing on the amount of exclusionary ties. The multicultural heterogeneity did not either have big influence on the composition of different types of social ties. The sample is large (738 children, 50 school classes) and therefore, the results can be generalized to similar cultural environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:34Z (GMT).

Recent research points to the importance of coherence in professional development as a means to improving implementation. Policy researchers have defined coherence in terms of alignment of standards, curriculum, and assessment is key to supporting implementation, while teacher learning researchers have analyzed coherence as an aspect of teachers' perception influenced by features of their professional development. This paper presents an expanded model of coherence that focuses on teachers' perception of alignment of curriculum materials that are the focus of professional development and on the fit of the materials to their local school context. Using empirical data from a state-wide systemic inquiry science reform effort targeting students from kindergarten to eighth grade, we describe how these two factors influenced teachers' global perceptions of the coherence of their professional development activities and subsequent implementation of curriculum materials.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:35Z (GMT).

We organize these practices into the technical, creative, and critical practices of Media Arts production and offer a new conceptual framework for this emergent field. Media Arts are particularly relevant to the learning sciences because of the shared focus on new technologies and computation.

Based on the COPES-model (Winne &amp; Hadwin, 1998) the impact of epistemological beliefs on learning is tested here experimentally. In this study, students (21 humanities students, 14 biology students) had to solve five tasks of different complexity (Anderson et al., 2001) with a hypertext on ""genetic fingerprinting"". Results indicate that students adapted their concurrent thoughts and concurrent actions to task complexity in this enactment stage. An epistemological sensitisation was administered that elicited more ""sophisticated"" beliefs and caused more elaborate learning processes. For example, students with this sensitisation employed more metacognitive planning, especially for more complex tasks. Additionally, effects of prior domain knowledge were investigated.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

According to the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning such representations can be powerful learning tools. The study described here approaches this theory from the domain of history in co-construction tasks. In an experimental study, the dialogues of pupils who co-constructed either textual representations or multimodal representations integrated in a timeline were compared. The participants were 12 to 14-year- old pupils in pre-vocational secondary education who worked in dyads on a series of four history tasks. Dialogue protocols of the taped student conversations for one of these tasks were analysed. The results show that integrated multimodal representations do to some extent lead to more discussion about domain content as well as about procedural issues than working with textual representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:37Z (GMT).

One important factor that can increases cognitive load is the number of links per page (DeStefano &amp; LeFevre, 2007). Several navigation support techniques, such as link suggestions, have been proposed to reduce cognitive load. In an experiment we tested the effects of number of links and link suggestions on cognitive load and learning. Participants used different hypertext versions, 3-links or 8-links per page, and with link suggestions or not. Participants with navigational support selected a more coherent reading text order and learned better at situational level. More interestingly, the effects on cognitive load were mediated by the hypertext reading order. Participants that selected a low coherent reading order suffered more cognitive load independently of the number of links presented. Implications for research and the design of navigation support systems are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It involves a dialectical balance of opposition and agreement, requiring negotiation and affording conceptual change through the co-construction of understandings. In classroom science inquiry with complex visual data representations, argumentation is an essential discourse structure through which students make sense of data and domain concepts. This study analyzed the argumentation practices of middle school students conducting an earth science inquiry project using data visualization tools. Analysis of spoken and gestural interactions during small-group work of one group of students in each of three classrooms revealed three common modes in which students employed visual data in argumentation: (1) using data-referenced talk and gesture to challenge authoritative positioning; (2) using gesture to participate in argumentation with incomplete conceptual vocabulary; and (3) using argumentation about data as a means of co-constructing the goals of academic tasks.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:38Z (GMT).

The Numerically Driven Inferencing (NDI) paradigm's research (e.g., Ranney et al., 2001; Munnich, Ranney, &amp; Appel, 2004) suggested that a curricular module highlighting evidential/scientific thinking might enhance reporters' quantitative and analytic skills. The resulting controlled experiment involved 55 first-year journalism graduate students, our ""Numbers, News, and Evidence"" module, 4.5 classroom hours, 20 homework hours, and several (e.g., Pre-, Mid- and Final-test) assessments. Post-module findings indicate success: Relative to control data, the experimental group improved on the main numeracy measures: 1) estimation accuracy and 2) math competence involving simple problem solving, data analyses, and exponential growth. Students and faculty both concluded that future students should also receive numeracy modules. The module apparently influenced students' attitudes about numerical information, too. The collective results may benefit journalists, their instructors, and media consumers.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:38Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This study of 100 online summer course participants indicates that the willingness to contribute to discourse depends on the type of motivation.

Our exploration of student learning is conducted as a design- based research study, with students who participated in national and international, multi- institutional design-courses. Findings indicate that by integrating approaches from the Learning Sciences and the Instructional Systems Design worlds, the instructional model developed in this study supported students to design pedagogically sound educational technologies.

By mapping DBR issues to the conceptual and technological features of e-research, and illustrating those features with concrete examples from a range of research domains, the paper demonstrates how e-research approaches and tools could enhance present DBR practices as well as open avenues for new research questions and new ways of doing research. It concludes by discussing potential challenges and outlining some critical elements for the uptake of e-research in learning science.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:39Z (GMT).

Our Scaling Up SimCalc project has completed experiments in which over a hundred mathematics teachers in 7th or 8th grade used either SimCalc or their existing materials. We found that students of teachers who used SimCalc learned more. In this paper, we look specifically at the issue of cognitive complexity through a case study of two teachers, contextualizing the case study within aggregate data. Aspects of the theme of cognitive complexity can be seen in (a) student performance on different types of test items (b) teachers' report of their own daily teaching goals and (c) discourse patterns in different classrooms. Although this analysis is preliminary, it reveals the potential of understanding Learning Science-based interventions more fully by combining large-scale and case study data.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:39Z (GMT).

In addition to documenting the specific content of students' conceptions in particular domains, some researchers attempt to make more general claims, both within and across domains, about the nature of intuitive knowledge. These attempts involve an implicit assumption that the character and function of all intuitive knowledge is the same that there is a single kind of thing called ""intuitive science knowledge"" that can be singularly characterized. The purpose of this work is to call that assumption into question, and we present examples to highlight our concerns. We propose a theoretical framework that provides a way to more carefully frame our research on intuitive science knowledge and demonstrate how it can be used to bring additional clarity to current discussions in the literature.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:39Z (GMT).

Previous results showed that the awareness tool positively affected learning gain by enhancing the production of elaborative talk and knowledge negotiation. In the present paper, we describe the actual use of a knowledge awareness tool during the course of interaction by analyzing the gaze paths recorded during the experiment and how they relate to learning performance and verbal interactions. The results showed that learners refer to the knowledge awareness tool episodically during the course of collaboration, mainly to assess the epistemic value of the information provided by the peer, especially when the peer seems uncertain about his understanding.

Without meaningful feedback from the agent, there is no reason to expect much student's engagement with the teaching interaction and growth in learning. This study tries to investigate the design of agent tutee's question prompts that can engage the student's role-playing as tutor and thereby stimulate reflective knowledge-building in a learning-by-teaching agent environment, Betty's Brain. A pilot study that compares question prompts with self-reflection prompts within the agent environment is undertaken. Question prompts are more specific and concrete questions related to the tutor's teaching and in which the student tutor needs to respond. Self-reflection prompts are more general prompts to stimulate self-reflection. The result gives us some preliminary evidence that the question prompts support on role-playing can be positive in enhancing student's learning when pursing learning-by-teaching activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:40Z (GMT).

For example, a student may frame a learning activity as an opportunity for sensemaking or as an assignment to fill out a worksheet. The student's understanding of the nature of the activity affects what she notices, what knowledge she accesses, and how she thinks to act. Previous analyses have found evidence of framing primarily in linguistic markers associated with speech acts. In this paper, we show that there is useful evidence of framing in easily observed features of students' behavior. More broadly, we describe a dynamic among behavior, framing, and the conceptual substance of student reasoning in the context of collaborative active-learning activities in an introductory university physics course.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:40Z (GMT).

However, there are still some doubts concerning the theoretical explanation and the boundary conditions of the modality principle. An overview is given with regard to these two points. Furthermore, two experiments are reported, which aimed at clarifying the theoretical explanation (Experiment 1) and the boundary conditions of the modality effect (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 was conducted to test whether the modality effect occurs irrespective of the temporal contiguity of text and pictures. In Experiment 2, it was investigated, if the modality principle also holds for longer, complex texts and if the time available for information processing acts as a moderating variable.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:40Z (GMT).

The analysis of the video-based examples was either supported by additional examples displaying the equivalent argumentative structure or by Conceptmaps visualizing the argumentative structure. The control group received no help. We found that examples of argumentation could be successfully employed in order to teach skills of argumentation. Covariance Analysis revealed no main effect of help design on learning outcome. However there was a significant effect of learners' help seeking activities. Learners who used the help facilities more often showed significant higher learning outcomes.

The study involved two groups of learners, ages 13 to 15, over twelve months. The physical robots have a dual-mode ability that allowed learners to record and observe motions while controlling the robots manually by hand as well as under program control. A custom-made Logo programming environment together with new 2D graphical elements was created. The results not only show examples of Balance Control concepts that emerged, but highlight the learning process that was made accessible only through the computational technology.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:41Z (GMT).

We present a blended model that accounts for the flow of ideas within such a curriculum. Using a co-design methodology, researchers collaborated with veteran secondary science teachers to create engaging curriculum that provided the context for two studies. Study 1 created a four-day biology lesson where 104 grade-ten students developed a knowledge base of ideas about human physiology, then connected those ideas to inquiry activities. Students and teachers succeeded in collaborative knowledge construction, and individual students demonstrated impressive learning gains. Study 2 extended these principles to create an eight-week curriculum unit on biodiversity. This study replicated the co-design process, resulting in a successful curriculum, and further refined our technology environment. The outcomes of this work offer promising evidence for a blended model where knowledge building intersects with scaffolded inquiry.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:42Z (GMT).

I focus on how the interplay between two of these factors, space and narratives, can be mediated with cultural tools of locative technologies such as Augmented Reality games and GPS units. In order to understand how place-based pedagogies affect learning and how locative technologies, like Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and Augmented Reality Games on Handhelds (ARGHs), help connect learners to cultures of place I examine experiences with place-based video games in a deep woods camping environment. Drawing together research in sociocultural learning, design, embodiment, environmental education, experiential education, human geography, and video games, this paper demonstrates how ARGHs can restructure a learning activity to (1) better connect learners to place, (2) increase and mediate their physical activity and social interactions, and (3) help enculturate them into a community of practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:42Z (GMT).

To enhance the effectiveness of the approach the measures erroneous examples and elaborated feedback were additionally implemented. 153 medical students were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions of a 2x2-factorial design (errors vs. no errors, elaborated feedback vs. knowledge of correct result (KOR)). In order to assess the sustainability of the learning environment a subgroup of subjects (n = 52) was compared with a comparable group of students who did not participate in the experiment (n = 145) with respect to their performance in a regular multiple choice test. Results show that the acquisition of diagnostic knowledge is mainly fostered by providing erroneous examples in combination with elaborated feedback. These effects were independent from differences in time-on-task and prior knowledge. Furthermore, the effects of the learning environment proved sustainable.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

While previous research has shown that students are aware of several analytical heuristics and imagistic strategies for problem solving, there have been no studies exploring how experts in organic chemistry approach problem solving. Here, we identify problem solving strategies employed by ten chemistry experts to solve undergraduate organic chemistry assessment tasks. Our findings suggest that experts employ a range of imagistic and analytical strategies for reasoning about spatial information and prefer, on average, to use analytical strategies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:43Z (GMT).

In this paper, we look closely at teacher and student discourse in a typical high school science classroom to investigate what the teaching and learning of scientific method looks like and to consider the impacts an emphasis on method has on students' inquiry performance. Through a lens of activity theory, our analysis suggests that test-oriented scientific method did not support authentic scientific inquiry. Instead, this focus served to draw teachers' attention away from student thinking and distract students from their ongoing, productive inquiry. By situating the case in a broader institutional and social context, we discuss how the teaching and learning of the scientific method as inquiry is supported and sustained in our current educational system. We conclude the paper with directions for further studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We present a study in which children with autism engage in collaborative narrative with both a virtual and a human peer, and the use of contingent discourse is compared. Our findings suggest that contingent discourse increased over the course of interaction with a virtual peer, but not a human peer. Furthermore, topic management, such as introducing new topics or maintaining the current topic, was more likely to occur with the virtual peer than with the human peer. We discuss general implications of our work for understanding the role of peer interactions in learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

From the perspective of learning, the ability to interpret and apply cases is a skill that is key to successful transferable learning. Our study explored the development and transfer of case use skills in middle-school project-based inquiry classrooms. Contrary to our expectations, group performance and capability did not improve uniformly over time, but fluctuated from episode to episode, leading us to examine what seemed to influence this fluctuation. We discovered that the character of group discussions and the impact of those discussions on the group's reasoning about the case were strong indicators of group performance and capability. In this paper, we describe case use and examine the character of group discussions reasoning about expert cases from episode to episode of case interpretation, exploring how these factors indicate or predict group interpretation performance and capability over time.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:43Z (GMT).

System dynamics models provide a top-down aggregated representation of a system with an emphasis on understanding time delays and feedback. Agent-based models provide a bottom- up representation, using animation, allowing system-level concepts to emerge from the interaction between individuals. Their joint use is becoming more common among scientists researching complex systems.

The analysis answers questions about how an abstract representation of a case is constructed through discourse, and about what cognitive products result from that construction. The analysis relies on a generic learning model that supports the coding and quantification of learning discourse. This analysis is demonstrated through its application to a set of dialogues taken from 2 groups of medical students who, as part of their professional training, were asked to explain the medical ethics engendered by two patient cases. The analysis shows that the learners strengthen their existing conceptual knowledge, rather than acquire new conceptual knowledge, and specifically that they make valuable new connections between structurally similar episodes, and between concepts and specific facts of the case. We assess the value of an analysis of cognitive processes for characterising collaborative case-centred discussions, and its use in showing differences of processing of information in different learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:44Z (GMT).

The effectiveness of feedback will depend on features of its quality. We describe guidelines for giving effective feedback including giving overall grades, levels and functions of feedback, and practices in effective feedback. The guidelines are based on a review of research of feedback on writing as well as general theories of feedback. We learned that in order for students to benefit from feedback, they have to (1) notice it, (2) accept it, and (3) understand what to do with it. After reviewing the research, we end with recommendations that support these notions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:44Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Some experiments reported improved recall after problem- based group discussions. However, these experiments did not control for individual differences in prior knowledge and quality of discussions. This experiment aimed to keep these variables under control. 62 students were trained on a physical topic (waves). One week later, they observed a video-recorded problem-based group discussion. In the experimental condition, students observed a discussion relevant to the trained material and verbally participated. In two control conditions, students either observed the relevant or an irrelevant discussion, without participating verbally. Then, all participants studied a relevant text. Immediate and delayed cued recall measures were taken. The experimental group was expected to recall more correct propositions than both control groups. A preliminary analysis with a one-way ANOVA showed a significant difference between the conditions on the delayed, but not on the immediate measure. A tentative conclusion therefore is that the verbal participation improved long-term recall.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:45Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Three versions of the laboratory work were carried out leading to different student productions. Three aspects will be presented in the present paper, which are related to the three conceptual difficulties that appeared in our a priori analysis: the importance of students' everyday knowledge of angles and of anatomy of human crania, the problem of knowing how many points make up an angle, and finally, the way in which students determined a reference system to construct an angle.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:45Z (GMT).

From social theory, the bystander effect has been used to explore online participation between members of a classroom. We propose a variant of the bystander effect in order to account for tutor participation patterns in online exchanges between anonymous participants. The Good Samaritan effect, named to capture the spirit of volunteers who come to the aid of strangers in distress, has four underlying mechanisms: self-awareness, social cues, blocking/inviting, and responsibility.

However, so far the literature failed to find clear benefits of animated diagrams. Consequently it is worthwhile to investigate conditions under which enhancement of learning occurs. In the present study interactivity of the display and spatial ability of learners were examined. Three modes of presentation were compared: static diagrams, animation with interactivity, and animation with focus, also combined with interactivity. The interactive animation condition with focus acquired more knowledge than the other two conditions while the interactive animation condition scored worst. High-spatial ability subjects performed better on the knowledge acquisition measures than low-ability subjects. The interactive animation condition with focus is particularly beneficial for low- spatial ability subjects. These results indicate that combining the conditions of interactivity and focus does lead to improvement in learning from animations, particularly for low-spatial ability subjects.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:46Z (GMT).

This paper deals with the tension between the authenticity of design- based learning situations that is often strived at and the inherent complexity of the design process and CAD as a representational tool of the trade. We describe a three-dimensional framework for comparing innovative project-like scenarios in technology curricula to more traditional instructional sequences for science learning. We subsequently developed a dissociated geometry-oriented and an integrated technology-oriented CAD training and studied their influence on the way pupils engaged in a design task. Although the results show evidence of the complementary roles of different types of representations, no effect of type of CAD training is found. In the discussion, we propose potential explanations for these findings, by relating back to our framework, and make a suggestion for future research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:46Z (GMT).

Using the characteristics of professional community created by Kruse, Louis &amp; Bryk (1995), we describe the development of professional community of sixth grade middle school teachers implementing literacy strategies across their content areas through a work circle.

In this study, the GCC framework is extended to the VMT chat medium which consists of a shared whiteboard, chat message box and tools for students to construct mathematical representations. The analyses of these sessions were based on the Collaboration Interaction Model (CIM), a model designed to study the knowledge construction process of complex chat transcripts. This paper will discuss how participants mediate shared understanding of mathematical representations and form mathematical arguments to construct new knowledge in the chat medium, using the CIM as the key instrument of analysis.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:47Z (GMT).

Sustained engagement was rare. Around 90% of user identities contributed only once. Nearly two thirds of threads on both boards did not get any reply. Sequential observation and content analysis were used to identify themes emerging in the discussion. Results revealed that although children came to the boards mainly for seeking help and asking questions, discussions around different curriculum subjects (Maths and English) were structured differently. Because of children's limited skills in asking questions, the boards had limited value for learning conversations. However, sharing emotional reactions to study and examination may still have made the resource a useful one.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It is therefore of great importance to learn about the challenges graduate students, with various disciplinary backgrounds, face when carrying out interdisciplinary scientific research. We used the weekly group meetings of an interdisciplinary research group, in the field of systems biology, as a platform to probe the challenges to learning interdisciplinary science. Group meetings were observed and interviews were carried out with the group members. A visible, if sometimes subtle, difference between the challenges facing biologists and those facing physicists was identified. Physicists encountered difficulties in grasping the biological knowledge organization; while biologists found the models suggested by physicists over simplistic. The views of the group members on the nature of the disciplines of physics and biology complement our understanding of the possible causes of some of the identified challenges.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:47Z (GMT).

Taking a social semiotics perspective in this study, we take the view that authoritative sources are inscriptions of cultural artifacts and science learning involves meaning making of these cultural artifacts. In studying the meaning making process of a group of students doing Problem-based Learning, our findings show that authoritative sources played an important role in deepening and expanding students' scientific knowledge. We also found that constructive use of authoritative sources involves interpretation of meaning in context. Therefore, we conclude that this structural coupling of authoritative sources and context for meaningful sense making has to be taken into consideration in the design of learning environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:47Z (GMT).

However, traditional learning environments are often disconnected from external communities of practice. For example, students might design and carry out scientific experiments that are valuable pedagogically, but do not contribute to science itself. In this study, we used the Game Ontology Project (GOP), a wiki-enabled hierarchy of elements of gameplay used by games studies researchers, in a game design class. Students found it useful for learning. However, encouraging sustained participation was challenging because students tended to view the GOP as a static source, rather than a participatory and editable resource. Expert analysis of the student's contributions to the ontology found them to be useful and significant.

We scored students' experimentation using three methods: total number of trials, how widely students changed variables between trials (variability), and how well students connected content knowledge to experimentation strategies (validity). Students made large, significant overall pretest to posttest gains. Regression models showed that validity was the strongest predictor of learning when controlling for prior knowledge and other experimentation measures. Successful learners employed a goal-directed experimentation approach that connected their experimentation strategy to content knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:49Z (GMT).

The game engine depicts qualitative physics phenomena via dynamics tied to player actions. Players progressively engage the epistemological entailments of charged particles through new phenomena they encounter as the game unfolds. We engineered discretely bounded gaming episodes to arrange transitions between game play, small group, and whole class discussions. Together, these elements of game play and discussion constitute recurring, game-centered dialogic activity cycles. Through this design, we investigate how gaming fosters intuitive physics understandings, how activity structures and materials engage learners and enlist gaming experiences in discussion, and how both game play and discussion shape subsequent participation. Analyses of trajectories of participation in and across cycles underscore the plausibility of this approach while also illuminating emerging tensions that we discuss in terms of epistemic reflexivity.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:49Z (GMT).

Two experiments using specifically designed tasks show a robust negative effect of distributed information on inferences. Detailed analyses of collaborators' discussions in Study 1 highlight the importance of specific inference patterns. Study 2 aimed to support these patterns of collaborative reasoning in a training phase, and tested the effects of support in a test phase. Two support measures were realized: written information on task difficulties and collaboration strategies, and an inference tutoring tool providing feedback and prompts based on an online assessment of students' collaboration. Results show that reflected experience with the training task improved subsequent unsupported collaboration. The best performance was achieved when the tutoring tool had been available during the training task.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

While interacting, they were able to access visualizations (individual concept maps) of both their own and their partner's prior knowledge (own and peer maps). Eye movements of both learning partners were recorded during the course of collaboration. Our goal was twofold. First, we focused on transactivity at both the visual and action levels. Second, we investigated the effects of knowledge interdependence with the partner on transactivity in collaborative concept mapping. We found that the degree to which participants co-manipulate the same objects in the collaborative map (action transactivity) is higher when they discussed identical (rather than complementary) information. Results from eye-gaze data showed that participants who shared complementary information transitioned more frequently between their own map and their partner's map; eye-movement transitions between own and peer maps were also negatively correlated with learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:51Z (GMT).

This model assumes that individual learning and collaborative knowledge building are based on the interplay between people's knowledge and the information available in the wiki. This interplay takes place in the form of externalization and internalization respectively. Individual learning is considered as happening through internal processes of assimilation and accommodation. Collaborative knowledge building happens through activities of external assimilation and accommodation. This study demonstrates these four processes in an experimental setting. As postulated by Cress and Kimmerle, the results show that a medium level of incongruity between people's knowledge and a wiki's information supports individual learning. A medium level of incongruity also leads to more external accommodation processes, despite the fact that high and medium levels of incongruity result in the same amount of text complements.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:45:51Z (GMT).

Worked-out examples have been shown to be an effective complement to untutored problem solving, but it is largely unknown whether they are an effective complement to tutored problem solving. Further, while computer-based learning environments offer the possibility of adaptively transitioning from examples to problems while tailoring to an individual learner, the effectiveness of such machine-adapted example fading is largely unstudied. To address these issues, two studies were conducted which compared a standard Cognitive Tutor with two example-enhanced Cognitive Tutors. The results indicate that adaptively fading worked-out examples leads to the highest transfer performance on delayed post-tests compared to the other two methods.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:34Z (GMT).

After completing 3 weblogs, a focus group interview was conducted to collect their feedback on the design and implementation of the research. The results showed that the students liked the way of writing online reflections. They attempted to make the weblogs interesting, convincing and logical. Also, they liked to view others' reflections and to give comments.

The papers that will be presented as part of this symposium will focus on three different phenomena: argumentation, production feedback and the incubation effect of collaboration. In addition, these studies also show that the effects of collaborative learning may not be apparent immediately following interaction, but need some time to materialize. This finding emphasizes the need for multiple and delayed assessment, as well as alternative assessment tools, such as prospective (instead of retrospective) measures of learning. .","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:42Z (GMT).

Indeed, this domain represents a very complex and dynamic environment dealing with a great variety of knowledge (declarative, pragmatic, procedural, gestural, etc.) that can be learned under diverse pedagogical forms. The four presentations describe various forms of computer-based technology, which aim to enhance the teaching and learning capabilities of doctors mostly in the form of 3D visualisation, full-scale simulation and haptic technology. They focus on research conducted in the area of anaesthesia and surgery. These studies emphasize on the necessity to adapt the learning environment to the objective of the training (validity of the learning situations). If the presentations are specific to the medical domain, their methodological and theoretical approaches can be generalized and used in other learning situations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:43Z (GMT).

Recently, there is an increased emphasis on learning that occurs outside formal institutions, especially through the use of technology. Design experiments and design-based research have resulted in several innovations and in an overall conception of designing and researching new learning environments. Not surprisingly, technology has been a critical component of research and teaching. Yet, this focus has primarily been on developed nations in the West. Recently the participation from other areas of the world, especially Africa, Asia, the Middle East, has been on the increase while the community of researchers and scholars is internationalizing. One area of innovation that has not been part of the community but which we wish to bring to focus through our symposium is the use of information and communication technologies for development (ICT4D) in emerging economies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:45Z (GMT).

Social networking applications like Facebook that interconnect people according to social or semantic relationships have become integral features of student life. Multi-user synchronous environments like Second Life provide rich, immersive experiences as well as new forms of online community. Such applications are blooming in every corner of society, influencing the ways in which people learn and exchange with one another.

For example, do complex systems ideas represent learning challenges that are qualitatively different than learning other scientific knowledge? What are the differences in pre-conceptions students have about complex systems phenomena and more expert scientific ways of thinking in these areas? What are the profiles of successful and less successful ways of learning about complex systems conceptual perspectives? Can complex systems provide conceptual perspectives for cognitively ""seeing"" physical and social sciences subjects in new and interconnected ways?

Data are drawn from interviews and field observations with professional musicians who collaborate regularly for performances, corporate engineers working in groups, and community members exchanging perspectives on sustainable practices for their village. Performing chamber music, designing a new technology-driven plane, or making decisions about sustainability in rural communities, all require sophisticated collaboration to generate ideas from multiple perspectives, problem solve, and innovate. The research we present explores the demands on the environment, the relational space, and the shifts that occur for participants in their collaborative settings.

Using them can lead to a deeper level of cognitive processing when learners make mental transformations between representations. However, research has revealed two problems. First, it has been shown that learners often do not make spontaneous use of such multiple options. Second, the translation process is often difficult. The papers presented in this symposium aim at supporting learners' use of multiple representations as well as their translation process. The first study provided learners with different types of representations and asked them to translate those into other representations. The second study examined the effectiveness of contextual scaffolds in computer simulations.The third study aimed at supporting hypermedia learning with multiple representations by means of metacognitive modelling and prompting of representational awareness. The fourth study investigated if sequencing dynamic representations combined with explicit instruction to relate and translate between representations has a positive effect on learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:49Z (GMT).

The class of methods discussed here looks at processes of learning in fine-grained detail, through which a theoretical framework evolves rather than is merely applied. This class of methodological orientations to studying learning processes diverges from more common ones in several important ways: 1) Attention to diverse features of the learning interaction; 2) conducting a moment-by-moment analysis, zooming in on the fine details of the studied processes; 3) rather than proving or applying a theory, the objective is to make theoretical innovations, or to develop a ""humble theory."" The challenge of using such techniques is that, by their nature, they do not follow a strongly delineated procedure, especially not the usual sort of coding. This symposium attempts to begin addressing the methodological issues by reflecting on several cases of data analysis.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These efforts have been aligned through the development and institution of Construct-Centered Design (CCD), a principled process that is based largely on evidence-centered assessment design (Mislevy, Steinberg, Almond, Haertel, &amp; Penuel, 2003) and learning goal-driven design (Krajcik, McNeill &amp; Reiser, 2007).

The WDP automatically produces complete transcripts of the online collaborative activity.

Fading implies to tailor support for collaboration, such as collaboration scripts, to the particular needs of the specific collaborators. In computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) settings, support can be designed in a very restrictive and inflexible fashion; at the same time computerized settings open new possibilities for the realization of adaptive support as they enable automation of analysis and feedback mechanisms. In this symposium we present new technical approaches and latest empirical research on possibilities and limitations of adaptive support for learners in CSCL settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:51Z (GMT).

It will be argued that whereas a common theme emerging from these studies is the importance of shared physical and social interaction within early years learning, digital technologies for this age group tend to be designed for individual use. Participants will be invited to offer explanations for this emphasis on individual learning and discussion will focus on alternative approaches to design that might take into account the intimacy of the interaction between young children and adults.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:53Z (GMT).

In this symposium we will use the term ""cognitive convergence"" to encompass various concepts that have been used to explain the important processes underlying successful collaboration, such as intersubjectivity, co- construction, knowledge convergence, common ground, joint problem space, and transactive reasoning. The goal of the symposium is to contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive convergence and to relate cognitive convergence to individual learning outcomes. We include studies that emphasize detailed analyses of the mechanisms, provide ideas about how to conceptualize and measure convergence, and include qualitative and quantitative measures of shared and converging learning outcomes. A special emphasis will be on methodological questions about how to analyze the processes of achieving convergence and how to assess how convergence affects outcomes of collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:53Z (GMT).

Gamestar Mechanic is an RPG (Role-Playing Game) style online game through which players ""take on"" the behaviors characteristic of professional game designers (e.g., designing games, accounting for variability change within a game's system, critiquing games). Reflecting on and practicing design can lead, we believe, to skills that are crucial for success in the modern, high-tech, global world. Game design is but a start in learning to think of complex interactions among variables, people, and technology, but it is also a domain that can help others reflect on complex interactions among systems. Early findings are showing that the pedagogical design of Gamestar Mechanic has the potential to help participants develop understanding of technical concepts particular to game design, systems-thinking skills, and other behaviors associated with the domain.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:53Z (GMT).

The design-based research studies of mathematical and computational literacy present sample student artifacts and discuss the learning they evidence. Collectively, we posit that overcoming the following obstacles could make virtual worlds both effective and exciting learning environments: professional development (technical skill, affective disposition), collaboration with school systems (logistics of access, allocation of resources), alignment with targeted content (harnessing students' creative divergence), and initial learning curves (issues of teacher-to-student ratio).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:54Z (GMT).

Some researchers have argued that modeling is fundamental to scientific inquiry (e.g. Clement, 2000). There has been increased literature on how to use inquiry and modeling for science learning. However, challenges still exist. For example, how do different modeling tools and learning activities shape student learning trajectories? How do they impact student science learning? What are the assessment measures that can serve as formative and/or summative purposes in the different learning environments? This symposium introduces how computer-based MVT (i.e., NetLogo, Biologica, and Astronomicon) were integrated into different learning environments, and highlights how alternative and formative assessment measures have been used for assessing student learning progression and outcomes. The symposium concludes with some general principles for designing MVT enhanced learning environments and understanding of models and modelling as assessment toolkits to gain an insight into student conceptual development.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:55Z (GMT).

Convergent conceptual change is achieved as participants in a conversation update common ground through presentations, repairs, and acceptances of utterances. Many previous studies in human-computer interaction show that face-to-face communication is more effective than other forms of technology-mediated collaboration, such as video conferencing or telephoning, primarily because such forms of communication cannot fully replicate the context so vital to common understanding. To meet these concerns while enabling the use of handhelds, we devise and test empirically the value of shared visual context in creating common ground by examining communication efficiency.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:46:58Z (GMT).
