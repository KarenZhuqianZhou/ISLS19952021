A crucial and unique component is the use of sequenced texts related to a single over-arching topic, enabling students to use their expanding prior knowledge while reading complex expository texts. BRAVO, consistent with Common Core State Standards, bridges the divide between grade-school narratives and secondary-level textbooks.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:14Z (GMT).

The hypothesis was that a social justice perspective and the use of near-peer teachers are motivating for elementary school children with little prior exposure to computer science. Using a mixed-methods approach, the study employed pre-post surveys, focus group interviews, observations, and an assessment rubric for student projects. The data show measurable increases in students' computer science identities, capabilities, and networks of support, and provide information that was used to strengthen the next phase of the program. High school-aged near-peer teachers also benefited from the program. They described growth in their leadership and communication skills and recognized their position as role models for the younger students.

We conducted both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis of the students' contributions. We found that students modified inconsistencies within a text by changing the text, sometimes even by changing scientific facts. When learners revised inconsistencies between the text and their own attitude they did not change their personal therapeutic health concept, but transformed the text to fit their own perspective. Finally, we found that students rearranged scientific facts to a higher degree if the text was not in line with their attitudes.

The paper explores the role of these design frameworks in articulating learning goals and outcomes, designing the learning experience to motivate student inquiry, and identifying features of technology tasks and tools to elicit artifacts and evidence. A pilot study with four teachers and 435 students revealed how to enhance elements of the design approach to strengthen the learning goals, improve learning experiences with visualizations, and streamline the flow of the curriculum to emphasize productive patterns of inquiry. Implications of this integrated approach for informing the design of learning environments, the scalability of designs, and teacher practice are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:17Z (GMT).

Researchers and developers, however, appear divided on the role of digital badges in motivating learners. Our paper addresses the skepticism and promise that surrounds badges and presents the design principles for motivating learning found among 30 digital badge projects and aligns them with research. In doing so, we consider how contextual factors--such as how badges are used recognize learning and how that learning is assessed--may play out to influence learner motivation in badge-oriented learning ecosystems.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:17Z (GMT).

Yet the QS movement is still new enough that very little is known about it, and there are many open questions about how QS might be of value to the learning sciences. This paper provides some history of the movement and through a qualitative analysis of a public video corpus of QS presentations, identifies the variety of participants, the reported motivations driving individuals to self-quantify, and the data analysis activities of some individuals active in the movement.

In this work-in-progress, we use both theoretical perspectives on the nature of novices' knowledge and empirical evidence of the context-dependent variability of students' reasoning in physics to question this assumption and to argue that characterizing students in terms of LP ""levels"" inadequately captures their understanding of force and motion. We then analyze one teacher's use of LP-based data to reason about student thinking and instructional responses. While the teacher reasoned fluidly using LP levels, he more frequently used finer-grained knowledge elements and contextual factors to interpret student thinking; and these finer-grained interpretations led to more actionable instructional implications. Thus, while recognizing LPs as models (imperfect representations) of student thinking, we argue that their assumption of ""levels"" of student understanding may limit their utility for classroom decision-making.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:18Z (GMT).

There are two experimental conditions; prompt and feedback and control. We investigated if there were significant differences on the performance on and use of sub goals among the different experimental conditions. Results indicated significant differences between experimental conditions, such that participants in the prompt and feedback condition had higher sub goal quiz scores, spent more time engaging in each sub goal, had larger page relevant ratios, and had lower irrelevant page ratios, compared to participants in the control condition. These results suggest the importance of scaffolding in promoting the effective use of SRL strategies while interacting with a hypermedia-learning environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:19Z (GMT).

Advances in educational technologies offer new opportunities and experiences for learners, but risk losing the natural forms of pedagogical storytelling afforded by face-to-face teacher-student discussion. In this paper, we present a technology-supported solution to the problem of curating and algorithmically delivering relevant stories to learners in computer- based learning environments. Our approach is to mine public weblogs for textual narratives related to specific activity contexts, both inside and outside the domain of the target skillset. These stories are then linked directly to task representations in the learner model of an intelligent tutoring system, and delivered to learners along with other tutoring guidance. We demonstrate our approach to curating stories by creating collections of narratives that are analogous to tactical tasks of the U.S. Army, and evaluate the difficulty of incorporating these stories into intelligent tutoring systems.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:19Z (GMT).

This paper argues that examining transfer from the realm of a digital game to the realm of a discipline as a case of analogical reasoning can be productive when trying to understand and later design scaffolds that connect the knowledge representations embedded in games to formal disciplinary knowledge representations used at school. This claim is supported through (1) an analysis of the design of a multiplatform commercial educational game Dragon Box 5+, aimed at teaching children to solve algebraic equations; and (2) tracking the experiences of several players. The transfer from procedures in the game to algebraic procedures is explored as a case of analogical reasoning, specifically addressing central sub-processes such as retrieval, mapping, evaluation of inferences, and the role of prior knowledge in these processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:19Z (GMT).

In Iteration 1, learners focused on tree identification; Iteration 2, learners focused on tree life cycles. We focus here on Iteration 2, where children completed a pre- and post-test assessment and participated in a photographic collage task to document a tree's life cycle. Findings suggested that a touch-screen conceptual organizer that provided a model of the life cycle, along with text and contrastive images, supported people's observations. The learners also collected photographic evidence of life cycle stages in a knowledge generative task. Increases in factual and conceptual knowledge of the life cycle were observed pre- and post-test; however, learners did not show consistent appropriation of new scientific vocabulary.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:19Z (GMT).

Professional development resources around educational innovations that are personalized to appeal to the needs and motivations of different types of faculty offer a possible solution. The method of developing ""personas"" to represent key types of users is commonly employed in user-interface design and can be used to produce personalized resources. Personas are fictional named archetypes of users encompassing generalizations of their key characteristics and goals that emerge from interviews. This method is especially powerful because personas succinctly package information into the form of a person, who is easily understood and reasoned about. Herein we describe the creation of a set of personas focusing on the needs and motivations of physics faculty around assessment and teaching. We present the personas, a discussion of how they inform our design and how the method can be used more broadly.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:20Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Seven teachers and 71 students in an upper secondary school participated, along with one researcher. Three lessons were designed and implemented in three different student groups (N=24, 23, 24), with one intervention for each group. The interventions were designed in an iterative process: the result of the first lesson formed the base for the development of the next, and so on. A multi-case analysis was conducted within and between each intervention. The results of the study describe correlations between teachers' deepened theoretical knowledge, changes in lesson design, and impact on students' learning outcomes in a long-term perspective. We found students' learning outcomes increased during the three interventions in three different groups of students (A +0.17, B +0.87 and C +1.54). At the delayed post-test, the learning gain in the third group sustained to be higher than in the previous two groups of students (A -0.08, B +0.26, C +0.75).","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:21Z (GMT).

Pre-post comparisons show that students made significant gains, both in terms of computational thinking and the relevant science con- cepts.

By mining the usage log files of over 40 teachers who used the CCS over a yearlong period, we analyzed for variability using a framework developed in marketing research to characterize appropriation of technology. This analysis helped reveal different kinds of teachers' patterns along two dimensions: frequency and variability of use. We then turned to qualitative records of teachers' experiences during the year to better understand why those variations appeared. Focusing on the experiences of several teachers, we distilled ""contextual contingencies"" that influenced how they chose to appropriate and use the CCS.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:21Z (GMT).

Such issues often require the interpretation of inscriptions (graphic representations of information) to evaluate claims. Research on socioscientific reasoning has shown that students often do not use relevant science or subordinate it to personal or social concerns. Research has not yet looked explicitly into how students interpret different types of inscriptions as potential evidence for use in socioscientific reasoning. This study compares upper elementary students' use of scientific and editorial inscriptions in their arguments about socioscientific issues. Using a pre/post design, we investigate students' use of inscriptions before and after a semester of science instruction focused on the coordination of claims and evidence.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:22Z (GMT).

In this paper we employ the dual eye tracking paradigm in the context of online collaborative geometry problem solving to quantify the degree of joint attention evidenced in gaze patterns, and explore what qualitative factors facilitate gaze coordination by focusing on the interactional organization of sequences in which gaze recurrence takes place.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:22Z (GMT).

In this effort, mathematical tasks operated as a boundary object, acting to organize cooperative work despite a lack of consensus regarding their meaning or purpose. Exposing and understanding this lack of consensus during joint work at community boundaries provided opportunities for learning in the form of changed practice and activity. Evidence for learning through coordination is presented, such as the communication of curricular vision and the routinization of a task rating process. Where lack of consensus led to potential conflict, as in the case of task adaptation, evidence for learning in the form of new practices was less evident.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:23Z (GMT).

The participants were 23 international graduate students from two different cohorts enrolled in a two-year Learning Sciences master's program. Students from each cohort formed a different community, with Community 1 having thirteen participants and Community 2 having ten participants. A mixed methods approach was adopted to capture community development from different angles. Data were collected through video recordings of community meetings and a needs analysis questionnaire. Results show that although the stages of development suggested by Wenger, McDermott and Snyder (2002) are apparent in a similar fashion in both communities, they do not follow a linear and smooth sequence, which signifies that communities go through the stages but in their own ""living"" way.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:23Z (GMT).

We argue that the positive affect that the student experiences stems from an alignment between his identification as a sense-maker and his epistemological view of this physics course as one that that values sense-making. Conversely, we attribute his frustration to a tension between his identity and his epistemological view of his biology courses as descriptive and fact-driven. We discuss some implications of this model for students engaged in interdisciplinary sense-making more generally. In particular, we suggest that Gavin's frustration with the lack of attention to mechanism in his biology courses might ultimately serve to strengthen his sense of interdisciplinary connectedness and satisfaction.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:24Z (GMT).

For example, novice designers commonly use trial and error, which researchers liken to backward-reasoning. Experts use forward-reasoning, which allows them to accurately predict the impact of certain decisions. In this paper, we present a complementary conceptualization for how experience affects design approaches. We liken backward-reasoning to example-based reasoning, and forward-reasoning to principle- based reasoning. In study 1 (N=13) students complete an engineering design activity. A qualitative analysis shows clear instances of example- and principle-based reasoning strategies. Study 2 (N=20) compares the efficacy of the two approaches by using a between subject design. We find that principle-based reasoning improves the quality of designs (p &lt; 0.01) and learning of important engineering principles (p &lt; 0.001). This suggests that hands- on learning environments may benefit from encouraging students to employ principle-based reasoning.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:24Z (GMT).

In this research, we studied fifth graders' emotional engagement in elementary science classes redesigned to offer more ambitious, agentive learning. We examined student self-reports of affective states to address the following questions: (1) Do students in ""Agency"" classes report more positive or negative emotional experiences, compared to students in classes that use traditional, kit-based science units? (2) To what extent do students' emotional experiences vary as a function of class? Findings indicate that, after taking classroom differences into account, students in Agency classes generally felt more positive about their experiences in science than students in kit- based classes. Next steps include exploring differences across classrooms and synthesizing research on learning, affect and identity.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:25Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, in the attempt to make these programs more efficiently effective, the promotion of prescriptive GED writing pedagogies, based on an autonomous view of literacy, is likely. The long-term goal of this reflection study is to learn how to thoughtfully develop a framework - based on a functional linguistics approach to grammar that foregrounds the social concept of identity - that can produce alternative GED writing pedagogies, promoting more socially-just effective practices within adult literacy programs and helping to ensure that adult literacy students have access to empowering academic writing curricula.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:25Z (GMT).

Analysis focused on data from one fifth-grade class in which students were challenged to collaboratively design, build, and program robots. Video-recorded and transcribed whole-class interactions from three design critique sessions across the second, third, and fourth day of a 14-day robotic engineering design project were examined in order to categorize the types of comments made by the teacher and students relative to the nascent design solutions of three focal groups. Collaborative discourse from subsequent small-group work sessions was then examined in order to understand what ideas students took up, as well as how they took them up and to what effect.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:25Z (GMT).

It focuses on the design tensions (Tatar, 2007) associated with coordinating the needs of participants from three different tiers of design--involving teachers, researchers, and district administrators--related to the content of designs and to the mechanisms for bringing content to scale within the district. This study argues for the value of a common vision and design methodology to enable design tensions at multiple levels to become generative influences on design.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:26Z (GMT).

Students are asked to work on a generation activity with a problem or with contrasting cases. This activity is aimed to foster transfer of the knowledge gained during subsequent expository instruction. The goal of the symposium is to contribute to a better understanding of how the generation activity is best designed to foster transfer. The contributions of this symposium varied the amount and type of generating by varying the materials (e.g., content of cases), the task (e.g., inventing vs. self- explaining), or the setting (collaborative vs. individual) of the generation activity. Mediating processes are also addressed. The symposium will clarify moderating conditions and mediating processes of how generation activities combined with expository instruction deploy their full potential.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:26Z (GMT).

Increased attention to children's learning across contexts highlights that meaningful learning can be ubiquitous across time, space, and situations. However, we need more understanding of how learning can be constructively linked across facets of children's lives, especially as they move through the world with their families. This poster symposium brings together people working on research and design of family learning experiences, in a variety of contexts. We aim to further understand 1) processes of learning across practices, time, persons and social/physical contexts, 2) the nature of learning processes in families, considering varied goals, values, and possible learning situations, and 3) what is being learned from new forays into research and design for family learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:28Z (GMT).

The study uses a quasi-experimental design in which four classes of 5th graders in Hong Kong participated in a unit focusing on electricity. The intervention involved students' collective inquiry and, epistemic reflection on what science is about; students used Knowledge Forum to collaboratively work on pursuing ideas; and students reflected on scientific progress with their own knowledge building inquiry. A scheme was developed in assessing students' views of science; and results showed significantly stronger effects for the knowledge-building group compared with the regular inquiry group on epistemic and conceptual learning. Regression analysis showed that students' forum engagement and epistemic views contributed to their posttest conceptual understanding over and above prior science knowledge. Qualitative analysis suggested how students' experience in knowledge building might shape students' understanding about the nature of science and improve their conceptual understanding.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:29Z (GMT).

The session will share findings and design principles from each of the studies around constructing technological scaffolds for physical performance reflections. The symposium highlights the various ways performance can be used to engage learners, and how different settings and learning goals affect the designs of performance representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:30Z (GMT).

This discussion and the related research are anchored in the acknowledgement that education programs should provide opportunities for learning and development of competencies required for knowledge-based work. We present empirical studies that examine learning in higher education courses in three different countries. These studies focus on student engagement, participation, and experiences in learning activities emphasizing knowledge practices that resemble professional work, and analyze how enrollment takes place and is facilitated by curriculum design and instruction. The findings show the nature and complexity of the knowledge practices embedded in the curriculum and how students become involved in these activities. The symposium delineates challenges for designing learning scenarios that support such enrollment. Ultimately, the symposium contributes to the ongoing discussion on how enrollment and curriculum design can stimulate and support knowledge-driven learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:30Z (GMT).

While dispositions are useful for connecting important aspects of students' proficiency, they are also broad and challenging to operationalize in empirical contexts. This symposium aims to promote dialogue around the meaning of dispositions as an analytic construct and to explore their relationship to other constructs relevant to helping learners become mathematical. We also aim to demonstrate that different methodological orientations allow us to see different aspects of what we all agree to call ""dispositions"". We present empirical work which address two foci within research on dispositions operationalizing in ways that enable documentation in a classroom context, and designing learning environments which foster positive dispositions to mathematics - in addition to a piece that bridges work between the two.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:30Z (GMT).

Specifically, we build bridges between two significant process-oriented approaches: Interaction Analysis (IA) and Knowledge Analysis (KA), to study how individual cognitive dynamics interacts with complex social dynamics. We demonstrate the kind of insights and outcomes of such integration, by zooming in, and explore two specific efforts to bridge KA and IA. Both focal pairs of analyses in this symposium make central use of the theoretical construct of coordination class, a theory is associated with KA usually used for analyzing the structure and dynamics of an individual conceptual system. Coordination class theory is used to extend an IA analysis in the first pair of analyses, and is elaborated on using IA methodology in the second pair. The presentations aim to stimulate discussions about the merits and constraints of such integrations.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Framed by cultural production theory, critical intersectionality, actor network theory, and a sociocultural-historical stance, these studies illustrate the interconnected nature of learning and becoming processes, the complexity of cultural forms and engineer/scientific identity productions, and the continued salience of structural forces to shape learning and becoming in life-wide settings. Ethnographic methods served these studies well by providing access to time-dependent processes, by immersing the researchers in their field sites over time, and by allowing seeing from the inside out to privilege the perspectives of research participants. Each study found ways to follow individuals and structures simultaneously, and to document cultural forms and variations in the ways insiders took up cultural forms.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:32Z (GMT).

These economic policies provide context for mathematization, as ordinary people grapple with the ways these policies affect their daily lives. In this article, we present an analysis of interviews with members of a Toronto-based activist network that fought against the City's proposed budget cuts in 2011 and 2012. We found that the context of activism spawned a wide variety of mathematics problems related to the activists' overarching goals: understanding the City's use of mathematics, creating their own mathematics, storytelling to the public, and behind-the-scenes tactics. We highlight the ways mathematical activity was always ideological, always accomplished through a division of labor within the group, and always strategically selected. We close by considering processes by which activist mathematicians can be better supported by formal and informal education.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:32Z (GMT).

We aim to contribute to the longstanding interest in argumentative learning in the learning sciences and extend knowledge about analyzing and supporting argumentation processes in FB. We examine the conditions under which FB can be harnessed for argumentative learning. We measure declarative knowledge outcomes and explore the development of attitude and civic behavior. Synthesizing across the papers, we will pinpoint the affordances of FB for argumentative learning, comparing processes to standard learning science approaches and exploring new socially embedded learning outcomes.

This session seeks to recognize and capitalize on the wealth of complex systems knowledge learned through everyday practices in informal contexts. We present arguments that are grounded in research taking place in four different communities--with Brazilian samba schools, triathletes, Native Americans, and environmental educators. The goal of the symposium is to discuss (1) how complex systems thinking can be developed through different practices in informal environments, and (2) how an under-representation of diverse samples and phenomena may eschew our understanding of complex systems thinking.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:33Z (GMT).

Paper one presents a multi-dimensional, ecologically focused design framework for supporting literacy as identity building among a cohort of African-American urban adolescents and presents data from a longitudinal study implementing the framework. The second presents the framework for a multi-site ethnographic methodology conceptualizing learning as expansive, focusing on generative repertoires for learning in diasporic and other non-dominant communities. The third presents design principles enacted in a program for African-American adolescent male development addressing issues of identity, perceptions, and relationships as drivers for robust learning and implications for policy and practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:34Z (GMT).

This effort has produced many interesting games though it is unclear if ""educational video games"" have achieved their promise. Similarly, for many years constructionists have engaged children in learning across a variety of contexts, including game design. While these programs have been successful, their exploratory nature leads to concerns about content coverage. In this symposium we discuss the potential of blending these two design traditions. Constructionist video games infuse traditional game structures with constructionist ideals to create gaming experiences that encourage exploration while ensuring engagement with desired content. This symposium presents the constructionist video games construct and showcases empirical research on the use of such games in both formal and informal contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:34Z (GMT).

We explore how disruptions to typical practice in terms of discourse, authority, participation frames, material and representational tools, and spaces and modes of learning are taken up, adapted, or rejected by learners, and how this informs design.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:34Z (GMT).

However, researchers in science education and researchers in mathematics education have tended to conceptualize ""teacher responsiveness"" differently. This structured poster session brings together researchers of teacher responsiveness in mathematics and science to begin hashing out, with each other and with attendees, the reasons for these differences. Do the different notions of responsiveness stem from epistemological differences between mathematics and science? From differences in the knowledge bases about student thinking in science vs. mathematics? This session will frame and initiate ongoing discussions of these issues, which are central to work on teacher cognition and practices in the context of teacher professional development--the focus of a growing number of learning scientists.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:35Z (GMT).

This symposium brings together researchers investigating how feedback can be optimized to maximize potential benefits. The four papers include studies investigating the effectiveness of feedback from various sources including expert, peer and automatically generated feedback in the domains of writing and math. The studies use a variety of methodological approaches including behavioral studies, eye tracking, and data mining. The discussion emanating from the results to be reported during the symposium will focus on how these empirical findings can help to inform feedback delivery in the classroom and how to more effectively design automated feedback.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:35Z (GMT).

Affect was compared for school vs. non-school, and within school, STEM coursework vs. non-STEM coursework. Within STEM, affect for a focal physics course was compared to affect for all other STEM courses. School was experienced with higher stress, lower intrinsic motivation, and lower self- efficacy than non-school. STEM and non-STEM courses were not experienced differently, but the physics course was experienced with higher stress and lower self-efficacy than other STEM courses. The results suggest that, broadly, university coursework may undermine intrinsic motivation and that the negative impact occurs in the midst of instruction. More tentatively, the process of engaging with challenging STEM content, such as that of the physics course, may tend to increase stress and undermine self-efficacy.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:35Z (GMT).

Tabak argued that scaffolding can be productively distributed across a learning environment's varied educational resources, proposing a ""synergistic scaffolding"" design pattern: ""different supports that augment each other; they interact and work in concert to guide a single performance of a task or goal"" (Tabak, 2004). This symposium argues that synergistic scaffolding is particularly apt for informal learning environments like museums, where visitors draw on a diverse array of technological, social, and physical resources while learning. Examples spanning collaborative data exploration, multi-context inquiry learning, mixed-reality simulations, and augmented reality exhibits are presented. Each details the educational resources either intentionally designed into the environments or appropriated by visitors as they learn. These examples highlight how designers can enhance informal learning by looking for potential synergies.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Moreover the cases provide insight into how researchers and practitioners can expand their focus on learning to include the connections and possible coordination across educational experiences in various contexts: school, afterschool programs, home, museums, and community spaces. A focus on cross setting learning recognizes all of these places as rich learning environments with their own histories and cultural practices.

Existing epistemic cognition research has tended towards characterizing this fundamental relationship as cognitive or belief-based in nature. This paper builds on recent calls for a shift towards activity-oriented perspectives on epistemic cognition and proposes a new theory of `epistemic commitments'. An additional contribution of this paper comes from an analytic approach to this recast construct of epistemic commitments through the use of Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to explore connections between particular modes of epistemic commitment. Illustrative examples are drawn from existing research data on children's epistemic talk when engaged in collaborative information seeking tasks. A brief description of earlier analysis of this data is given alongside a newly conducted ENA to demonstrate the potential for such an approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:41Z (GMT).

Learning-by-teaching is one such strategy. This entails forming students' groups of enquiry, who come to discuss their research findings with the whole class (learning forums), to encourage the building of shared knowledge. This poster uses quasi-experimental method to investigate the change in the performance of teacher-trainees when using learning-by-teaching strategy, after using non-learning-by-teaching strategies. The poster also explores students' perceptions on their use of the pedagogic strategy, in order to illuminate the conditions suitable for successful implementation of method. Three cohorts of students participate in the study over three years. Findings indicate that the strategy succeeds when students' motivation is high, resources are adequate, and timely corrective feedback is provided.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:46Z (GMT).

This article presents a 3-step guideline for second- order argument-scaffolding, namely (1) diagnosis of internal argumentative script, (2) adaptive external support, and (3) adaptive fading of external support.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:54Z (GMT).

Results indicate that multiple text users engaged with the texts in qualitatively different ways and created significantly higher quality models than single text users. Objectives This study examined how students used an intentionally designed text set to generate causal models of the carbon cycle prior to and following an instructional intervention. Using a series of rubrics, we analyzed the pre/post models to determine the extent to which students made use of the texts and the quality of the models that they created. We then examined the relationship between text use and model quality, focusing on the role of multiple-text processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:54Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The skills involved in noticing can be challenging to develop in teacher education programs because of the cognitive load involved in attending to the context of the real classroom environment. Teacher education programs can thereby study a precursor to noticing, such as framing. Framing instruction involves developing a range of ""seeing"" events in the classroom. Thus, preservice teachers must frame their teaching experience in ways that privilege student thinking. In our investigation, we characterized the frames preservice teachers employed in their reflection paper. We found that preservice teachers who used frames that were more attentive to student ideas were more capable at analyzing student understanding in written student artifacts.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:41:57Z (GMT).

With biology careers increasingly demanding mathematical approaches, students are better prepared to enter these careers if they can integrate equations with conceptual knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:00Z (GMT).

Scientific practices, conceptualized as a subset of social practices, are arrangements of comprehensible and comprehensive ways of knowing and doing. The links and separations between the social practices present in learning environments serve to structure the nexus of practices and allow for the tracing of engagement, participation and learning (Bell, et al., 2012b; Dreier, 2009).

Indeed, in the 21st century, one of the important aspects of media literacy became to know how to behave safe online. However, most educational packages on the topic of e-safety have been developed without much theoretical consideration, and they have not been evaluated. Design-based research has been put forth as a good methodology to considerately develop effective educational materials. Therefore, in this study, a design-based research approach was used to develop educational materials about the risks on social network sites. By developing solutions based on existing knowledge and improving these solutions in 5 iterative cycles of implementation, evaluation and revision, this research results not only in effective practical solutions, but also in context-specific design guidelines that can be used by future researchers, practitioners and educational developers.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:13Z (GMT).

Broadly, epistemic cognition encompasses explicit thoughts about the nature of knowledge as well as reasoning processes related to knowledge claims and justifications. Learning scientists are invested in understanding epistemic cognition in a variety of authentic settings, but it is challenging to analyze data in meaningful epistemic categories. Participants in this workshop will briefly discuss varied conceptualizations of epistemic cognition and will focus on how to apply these conceptualizations to empirical research. We will explore empirical methods that extend beyond traditional interview and questionnaire methods to better expose authentic, ongoing epistemic thinking. Presentations and discussions will explore means of revealing epistemic thinking in classrooms and other settings and methods of analyzing data from learners' interactions and discourse. A primary goal of the workshop is to foster collaborative, interdisciplinary future work.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:19Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

While ownership is beneficial to promoting science engagement, in this study, we show that conflicts in ownership of science learning manifest and can hinder learning. We document three focal learners who faced tensions and conflicts in their ownership of science learning. Specifically, we examine how learners' development and conceptions of ownership at home and school influenced how ownership of learning was expressed in an afterschool program called Kitchen Chemistry (KC). We argue that learners' expressions of ownership are a reflection of their identity development in science and that conflicts are a part of this manifestation.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:24Z (GMT).

This study traces how two high-performing fifth grade students engaged in scientific modeling across three modeling-centered units over one and a half years. To analyze their epistemologies in practice over time, we examined their model-based explanations and reflective talk about the rationale and purposes of their explanations. While both students developed more mechanistic explanations of phenomena, they did so in different ways. One developed a meta-level rhetorical strategy to explain ""how and why"" phenomena occurred, even in non-prompted contexts. The other used a reductionist analytical strategy to look for deeper level mechanisms of phenomena. These cases provide evidence that students develop EIPs across contexts, and leads to insights about what develops, what might influence this development, and how EIPs can be further supported in classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:24Z (GMT).

Such courses have obvious strengths in their ability to convey (usually lecture-based) content at extremely low cost to widespread, and often underserved, student populations. At the same time, MOOCs, for the time being at least, reflect traditional (and often contested) values in education: the default assumption for a MOOC is that a teacher or professor will present facts or interpretations, record these as video or slide presentations, and convey them to an extensive audience of (usually individual) students. This paper addresses the default assumptions of MOOCs in the light of two decades of research in the learning sciences, focusing on themes of collaborative work, embodied cognition, and both the limitations and opportunities of learning analytics. With these themes in mind, we suggest paths for research and exploration into the next generation of MOOC design.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:25Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These engaging firsthand experiences often need to be contextualized so that peripheral audiences are able to learn from them. We investigate how interpreters (a.k.a. docents, explainers) equipped with a tablet support tool (TST) are able to facilitate learning in a dynamic exhibit with high visitor traffic. This TST focused on re- representing user performance in the exhibit, and was designed to help interpreters shape visitor discourse and inquiry. Four cases are presented to illustrate how interpreters orchestrate their collaborative facilitation when a meditational tool is present, and how the epistemological role of TST shifts. We document interpreters successfully using TSTs to coordinate shifts in facilitation based on the state of the interactive exhibit, and using live data representations to connect visitors' personal experiences with exhibit content, demonstrating several potential uses of TSTs as mediational tools for dynamic exhibits.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:25Z (GMT).

Using semi-structured, focus group interviews, this paper describes participants' identity production as empowered computer scientists. Results indicate that Latinas faced many cultural constraints within the landscape of computing, including isolation, marginalization and microaggressions, yet they also described practices and relationships that helped them to persist in their majors. Successful disciplinary performances and access to Latina role models were pivotal in students' adoption of empowered identities. Study participants challenged the notion of computing as a competitive, individualistic enterprise that permeated the local and global computing communities in which they operated. Instead, they developed identities as engaged, community-oriented computer scientists and enacted these identities through their everyday practices in their departments and in the local community.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:26Z (GMT).

By applying educational data mining to students' log data, assessment metrics were generated for two key inqury skills, testing stated hypotheses and designing controlled experiments. Three models were then developed to analyze the transfer of these inquiry skills between science topics. Model one, Classic Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, assumes that either complete transfer of skill occurs or no transfer occurs; model two (BKT- PST), an extension of BKT, assumes partial transfer and tests that assumption; and model three, a variant of BKT-PST, assumes no transfer and tests this assumption. An analysis of models one and two suggest that transfer of these inquiry skills across topics did occur.

In reform-oriented activities, students first engage in concrete situations, wherein they achieve situated, intermediary learning objectives (SILOs), and only then they rearticulate their solutions formally. We define SILOs as heuristics learners devise to accommodate contingencies in an evolving problem space, e.g., monitoring and repairing manipulable structures so that they model with fidelity a source situation. Students achieve SILOs through problem-solving with media, instructors orient toward SILOs via discursive solicitation, and designers articulate SILOs via analyzing implementation data. We describe the emergence of three SILOs in developing the activity Giant Steps for Algebra. Whereas the notion of SILOs emerged spontaneously as a framework to organize a system of practice, i.e. our collaborative design, it aligns with phenomenological theory of knowledge as instrumented action.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:27Z (GMT).

It is proposed that during embodied experiences, learners reactivate multimodal representations of previously stored memories related to objects and events, and the mental perceptual simulations learners construct during embodiment enhance their learning and motivation. This paper presents the findings of a study that investigated the effects of different types of embodiment on the learning and motivation of adult learners. The study compared four groups, Direct Embodiment, Surrogate Embodiment, Imagined Embodiment, and No Embodiment (control). The findings suggest that learners learn better and have higher motivation when they engage in embodied learning than when they experience no embodiment, and that role-playing as avatars in virtual environments and role-playing physically both enhance learning and motivation more than imagining actions and reading. The findings suggest that role-play can make learning more meaningful.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:27Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Drawing on observations and students' narrative accounts of their working processes, the local design studio is portrayed as a well-attuned system of structural elements, patterns of interaction and epistemic assumptions. The findings reveal basic similarities but also significant differences with other studies on educational design studios.

A systematic analysis of the success of interventions on scientific reasoning is still missing, leaving unanswered questions regarding the magnitude of the effect of interventions for scientific reasoning; and which factors in the intervention and the assessment explain differences between studies. Effect sizes taken from 15 studies were included in a meta-analysis. The results revealed a large effect of interventions on scientific reasoning (g = 0.80). Moderator analyses included learning activities and, surprisingly, showed that constructive activities yielded larger effects than interactive ones. The meta-analysis is limited by the number of studies included. Nevertheless, the results show that scientific reasoning can be fostered, though the success of the intervention depends on variables in its content, pedagogy, and assessment.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:28Z (GMT).

In this study, we designed a science unit on nuclear energy using a newly developed online knowledge and learning management system that offers three types of representations: pictorial, textual, and concept maps. We investigated how learners organized their knowledge with multiple external representations and how their knowledge organization practices interacted with their argumentation. Our results indicated that concept maps and wiki entries were more connected than the pictorial modes in the network of knowledge entries created by the learners. Moreover, we found evidence showing that students' knowledge organization enabled them to draw information while arguing and that their argumentation guided them to advance their knowledge organization practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:29Z (GMT).

These reforms aim to not only have students doing things scientists do, but to have them doing them with the similar goal of constructing explanatory accounts of the natural world in principled, consistent ways. In this case study, we used a communities-of- practice framework to analyze how students' perceptions of the epistemological purposes of several classroom activities change over time. We found that students used their everyday experiences in ways that allowed them to engage in and describe modeling practices that contributed to their classroom's knowledge building goal. In addition, we found that students' articulations of that goal became more epistemologically sophisticated over time. Our analysis provides insights on how students productively use everyday experiences in scientific practices and offers suggestions for how to rethink learning progressions to account for students' perceptions of their modeling practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:30Z (GMT).

Since social factors influence learning from this paradigm, understanding which social behaviors a teachable agent should embody is an important first step for designing such an agent. Here, we focus on the impact of causal attributions made by a teachable agent. To obtain data on student perceptions of agent attributions, we conducted a study involving students interacting with a social robot that made attributions to ability and effort, and to the student, itself, or both. We analyzed data from semi-structured interviews to understand how different attributions influence student perceptions, and discuss design opportunities for manipulating these attributions to improve student motivation.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:31Z (GMT).

In characterizing teachers' progress toward greater responsiveness, researchers typically code teachers' attention as shifting toward the intellectual content (substance) of students' ideas and away from other foci such as students' correctness. These schemes, however, do not distinguish between different aspects of the substance of students' ideas. In this paper, we argue that a science teacher, Mr. S, demonstrates progress not by shifting toward greater attention to ""substance,"" but rather by shifting in the facet of student thinking to which he primarily attends and responds. He shifts toward attending to causal stories (mechanistic explanations) and away from causal factors (potentially relevant variables). We argue that such shifts toward more sophisticated epistemic practices should be targets of professional development and of the assessment of responsive teaching.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:31Z (GMT).

New questions emerge from the relation between objectified space and student activity: How do students react to the spatial resource opened at their disposal? What are their spatial modes of acting within it? What bearing does the spatial organization have on talk? This paper revitalizes the neglected semiotic connection between language and the city. The literature of the perspective of everyday life and other contemporary spatial literature are reviewed in order to better understand the use of space in CSCL discussions, the ways in which it is socially produced, reclaimed, planned, maintained and used. 37 small group Argunaut discussions were analyzed and examined for their spatial development. Four spatial practices are described. The practice of distribution is unfolded. This study argues that issues of proprietorship play a major role in the way discussions evolve.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Researchers and a high school science teacher co-designed a curriculum around a room-sized simulation of a rainforest. Using several large displays stitched together on each wall of the room, we created an immersive rainforest environment in which students worked collaboratively as ""field researchers"" to observe changes in life forms over two hundred million years and gathered evidence of evolution. The complex sequence of student interactions within the EvoRoom environment, as well as all materials, including large immersive displays, aggregated visualizations, and tablet applications were carefully designed as short inquiry activities that complemented the broader curriculum. This paper presents our designs over two iterations in terms of several key features that enhanced students' collective immersive experience and learning of evolutionary biology.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:32Z (GMT).

The log files, containing information about their overall performance, and self-report measures, assessing emotions and impressions towards agents obtained from their interactions with MetaTutor were used to assess the relationship between subjective agent- directed emotions, SRL processes and overall learning gains. Results indicate that agent- directed emotions were not significantly related to SRL strategy use, negative agent-directed emotions were significantly related to negative learning gains and negative agent-directed emotions for two specific agents (representative of two SRL pillars) were related to negative learning gains. Implications for the design of multi-agent systems and the role of emotions during human-agent interactions and their relation to learning are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:33Z (GMT).

So far, the Control of Variables Strategy (CVS) has demonstrated only limited success in supporting students' discovery of multiple variable relationships. In this report, we present an alternate strategy, which we call the General Principle Strategy (GPS). We report on preliminary results of a classroom study where we taught students in two conditions to use CVS or GPS, respectively, in the context of several physics topics. We find evidence that both strategies help students figure out the multivariable relationship underlying the working of a balance scale, as inferred from associations between their performance on a written posttest and on a computer game-based posttest. Based on these results, GPS shows promise as an effective way of teaching multiple variable relations that underlie a wide variety of physics phenomena.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:33Z (GMT).

We build on existing efforts by defining DBR as an iterative process of 6 phases: focus, understand, define, conceive, build, and test, in which other scientific processes are recursively nested. By better articulating the process of DBR, this definition helps us to better craft, improve, communicate, and teach design-based research.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:34Z (GMT).

For learners engaged in scientific practices, we aim for them to recognize scientific evidence from observations in the natural world. Here, we provide an early depiction of evidence construction, namely how evidence is constructed from one's prior knowledge and one's observations. We illuminate instances of teachers constructing evidence while engaged in a professional development workshop where they are tasked to reconstruct the geological history of a national park. We illustrate four cases, some of which involve the successful construction of evidence and some of which involve embedded challenges with constructing evidence, such as difficulties with background knowledge and individuals ""seeing"" different information in the same phenomena. This analysis illustrates the role of prior knowledge in scientific practices that rely on evidence construction in field-based complex environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:34Z (GMT).

The underlying principle of the proposed method is to extract syntactic and sematic information before segmenting the raw data and annotating them according to a multi- layer framework called ACODEA. As a bottom layer of the framework, the ""pre-coding"" phase makes it possible to translate the raw data into machine-readable and context- independent language, and to make Natural Language Processing tools aware of users' preferences and underpinning mechanisms of identifying the desired pattern. Explorative but promising evidence is reported toward a more comprehensive perspective by combining qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze the discourse data. Given those findings, we argue in favor of mixed methods of content analysis and they further generated directions for future methodological development and empirical applications.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:35Z (GMT).

There are varying views in the literature on the nature of science misconceptions and the role they ought to play in learning interventions, but we focus here on their manifestation in physical activity as opposed to their detection via standardized inventories. We describe a novel framing of incorrect and emerging notions of science, and we illustrate this framing with descriptions of students' embodied interactions in an immersive digital simulation of planetary astronomy. Through live observation and video analysis we identified 9 misconceptions that were made visible through the student's bodily activity rather than through verbal accounts. We conclude with a discussion of how these same diagnostic environments may be used for instruction and remediation.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

To investigate this hypothesis, we draw on evidence collected by youth researchers as part of a study of five learning environments that aim to support cross-setting pursuit of interests. Findings from this study support claims that youth do facilitate access to valued learning spaces for their peers, and that friendships can be central to sustaining interest in activities. The data from this youth ethnographic study supports placing a priority on relationships, as well as content, within sites for interest driven learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:36Z (GMT).

However, challenges exist regarding how to describe and measure indicators of this reciprocity. We explored the ways in which 8th and 9th grade students utilized physical dynamic tabletop models towards developing sophisticated understandings of full scale Earth System processes. This approach allowed us to identify and describe evidence of the ""bootstrapping"" that occurs between understanding the model as a scientific representation, and understanding the science concepts of the represented entities, configurations, motions, and emergent phenomena in the real Earth System. We argue that this notion of bootstrapping is a productive means to conceptualize and support the development of students' epistemological understandings of both scientific models and the represented science concepts.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:36Z (GMT).

The contexts in which learning occurs are in fact complex systems with elements or agents at different levels--from neuronal, cognitive, intrapersonal, interpersonal, cultural--in which there are feedback interactions within and across levels of the systems so that collective properties arise (i.e., emerge) from the behaviors of the parts, often with properties that are not exhibited by those parts. We analyze the long running cognitive versus situative learning debate and propose that a complex systems meta-theory of learning (CSMTL) provides a principled way to achieve a theoretical rapprochement. We close by considering other theoretical and methodological implications of the CSMTL for research in the learning sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:37Z (GMT).

The performance of a group receiving the treatment, Trained Argumentation with Modest Scaffolding (TAMS), was compared with an ecological control group that did not receive argument training: Emergent Argumentation with Modest Scaffolding (EAMS). We hypothesized that argument training would influence how students attended to, used, and shared instructional resources as evidence to support explanations in collaborative meaning making.

This analysis focuses on a group activity where children use a mobile app to identify a mystery tree, analyzed through video-based Interaction Analysis. The findings reveal a collective engagement afforded by a coordinated interaction between sensory modes (verbal, gaze, touch, spatial) and mobile technologies (iPads, AR content). The purpose of this analysis is to help researchers and educators utilize the analytical concept of the collective when designing or examining mobile learning activities outside of school.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:38Z (GMT).

However, the PC version (N2 = 27; M = 7;8 years) resulted in a small positive effect on intelligence (CFT 1: dmean = 0.28; meanTrainInt = .13) and verbal performance (HSET: dmean = 0.25, meanTrainVerb = .12). Compared to childhood cognitive development, even the small training effects observed in Study 2 are practically meaningful because they correspond to more than half a year of schooling and maturation.

Expert teachers provide guidance on generative tasks such as drawings or essays that encourages students to refine their understanding, often by gathering more evidence. We developed algorithms to score student drawings and designed guidance for each score level. The guidance was intended to promote coherent understanding. We compared computer-generated guidance to teacher guidance in two studies, conducted with over 300 students in secondary classrooms. The studies suggest that automated guidance is as effective as teacher guidance for improving student understanding. Teachers appreciated the assessment of class progress provided by the automated guidance. They reported that it took them several hours to grade their five classes of 30 to 40 students. Thus, automated guidance can reduce the time teachers spend evaluating student work, creating more time for planning lessons, facilitating inquiry, or guiding individual students.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:39Z (GMT).

The current paper, following the philosophical approaches of Martin Buber and Nel Noddings, suggests a way to enhance students' positive appreciation of collaborative learning as well as the extent and quality of their engagement in it. To this end, we propose a preliminary conceptual framework, called Computer-Enhanced Dialogic-Reflective Discourse, which explains the dimensions of discourse in which students co-explore the challenges arising from their collaborative learning experiences. We illustrate and discuss the supposed potential of our proposed framework.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:39Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Drawing from an episode of videotaped collaborative group work, this qualitative case study examines the microdynamics of positioning and, using a stimulated recall interview technique, explores how a girl who was working with a group of boys identifies, interprets, and explains these moment-to-moment acts of positioning. The findings point to the strength of this methodological triangulation by further elucidating verbal and non-verbal forms of positioning. Specifically, the results illustrate how the focal student was prevented access to shared learning artifacts and group discussion due to her group members' (likely unintended) `exclusive talk' and `physical blocks'. Whether and how the observed acts of positioning are associated with social categories (i.e., gender) are discussed and implications for the implementation of collaborative learning activities are raised.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:40Z (GMT).

Using reliable rubrics, we coded all VMCAnalytics created in a range of classes. These rubrics focused on the quality of the students' arguments and depth of their reasoning. Analysis showed that the rubric was useful in differentiating among the different groups of students. Moreover, different metrics had different degrees of correlation, suggesting that we were identifying several different dimensions of quality.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:40Z (GMT).

Teacher appropriation is important in studying professional development because far too often studies do not account for teacher learning and how this learning sustains reform- minded practices. Using two years of qualitative data we traced the appropriation of tools and their impact on instruction. Pushing on Grossman, Smagorinsky, and Valencia's (1999) five levels of appropriation, results indicate that the teachers appropriated tools for different pedagogical reasons, such as appropriating the tools to organize their students' learning, to accommodate their students' learning needs, and to integrate other professional development initiatives.

Using Bakhtin's work as an analytical frame, I suggest that shifts in identification should be seen as a temporary appropriation of a dialogic other's voice (or ideological stance) and suppression of one's preferred voice that is performed strategically according to one's situated interest at any particular point in time.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:42Z (GMT).

Building on theoretical works from learning sciences, educational psychology and sociology, shared epistemic agency is conceived as a complex phenomenon that emerges in a dynamic way, and is defined as a capacity that enables groups to carry out collaborative knowledge-based activities that lead to a shared outcome. A comparative analysis of empirical studies of agency shows different ways epistemic agency is expressed in the context of individual and collaborative groups' learning and research communities' knowledge work. This discussion foregrounds the idea that creating intellectual interdependence, which is deemed necessary to co-construct knowledge, is an effort that can be assigned both to individuals and groups, but also to how the structural context affords and facilitates this interdependence.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:42Z (GMT).

However, scientific modeling remains underemphasized in elementary science learning environments and more research is needed to understand early learners' engagement in domain-specific modeling practices. To address this need, we are engaged in design-based research to foster and investigate 3rd-grade students' model-based explanations for hydrologic phenomena. First, we developed an empirically-based learning performances framework that integrates relevant science content and modeling practices. This framework a) grounds the iterative adaptation and enhancement of a commonly-used curricular unit and b) lays the foundation for ongoing development of an associated learning progression. Second, we report on findings from analysis of 3rd-grade students' model-based explanations around the water cycle. Results indicate that elementary students generate mechanism-based causal claims and highlight target concepts and modeling practices emphasized in students' model-based explanations for hydrologic cycling.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:44Z (GMT).

We emphasize that it is necessary to extend current research about the epistemic aspects of participative learning and to take also the social aspects into account; we first review work on legitimate peripheral participation and how research on this topic is currently conducted. Then we describe the theoretical and methodological foundations of social network analysis. Exemplary studies that use social network analysis including studies on legitimate peripheral participation are presented. We conclude that social network analysis can enable us to make inferences about participative learning across specific setting and individual communities. For the future, the challenge is to relate dynamically changing patterns of legitimate peripheral participation to emerging and changing epistemic practices of a community.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:44Z (GMT).

This design-based study with a sixth-grade technology-enhanced inquiry science unit on global climate change investigates how critique can support students in refining their conceptual understanding. Specifically, the study investigates whether students' ability to benefit from critique is impacted by the complexity of the critique artifact. Findings show that students can equally benefit from critiquing explanations of varying complexity when guided to consider a range of alternative ideas during critique The results show the value of designing critique to support students in distinguishing among their own and alternative ideas. Case studies illustrate how students engaged with opportunities provided by the guidance, and indicate areas where further research is necessary to refine the design of critique as a means to support conceptual learning in science.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:45Z (GMT).

Using a mixed methods approach, quantitative patterns were identified in the distribution and content of student talk at multiple grain-sizes, which were analyzed in conjunction with pivotal sequences of interaction. Findings indicate that despite the existence of participation structures designed to foster equitable collaboration, inequities emerged in both dyads as students positioned themselves and their classmates with identities as more or less competent in computer science. While in the first dyad this positioning was often overt, in the second dyad positioning assumed a more passive form. Further, there is evidence that these positionings had an impact on students' opportunities to learn.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

There is some indication that desire is learned in social activity and informs identity development, which whets the appetite for conceptual elaboration. In this paper I draw from scholarship in philosophy, religious studies, and education to define and expand the concept. This work reveals how desire is directed, disciplined, and has consequences of critical concern. Conceptually, desire may also be preferable to motivation for researching and appreciating what Dorothy Holland (1992) labeled the directive force evident in individuals' participation within social activity systems. I refer to my own work in teacher education to illustrate how the concept frames important questions and lines of inquiry for further research.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:48Z (GMT).

In a 2x2-factorial design involving 81 students, the effects of slide projection (absent vs. present) and type of note-taking (on empty sheets vs. on handouts) were investigated with respect to the learners' processing of information and their knowledge about information presented on slides and about information presented orally immediately after a lecture and two weeks later after an additional review phase. Preliminary analyses indicate a beneficial effect of note-taking on handouts on knowledge about information presented on slides after the additional review phase, which appears to be mediated to a substantial extent by the processing of information presented on slides while watching the lecture. Hence the effect cannot be explained exclusively by the completeness of this information in the learners' notes.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:48Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Analytics is more accurate and less expensive than traditional ways of collecting and analyzing implementation fidelity data, and may allow targeted adaptations of the innovation that improve the quality of the research.

The results reveal that research trends in the Learning Sciences have remained largely consistent except in the area of individual differences and affect, which has increased over the years. Key strengths of Learning Sciences include research on small group learning, inquiry, problem solving, argumentation, and mixed-methods. As the LS reflects on its state of practice, it should recognize that the field has achieved many research distinctives, yet, there are several opportunities for further research growth.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:49Z (GMT).

This study examined the ways preservice teachers' knowledge of model-based inquiry (MBI) and their ability to use this knowledge in designing lessons developed over time. This study involved 15 preservice teachers enrolled in four consecutive methods courses in the biological certification program. Qualitative procedures were employed to analyze teaching philosophy papers and clinical interviews. Research findings provided evidence to support growth in preservice teachers' knowledge of MBI and its implementation in lesson designs: (a) from teacher-centered and activity-oriented to more student-centered lessons with modeling, and (b) from scripted to more sophisticated modeling practice. This study has the potential to contribute to teacher education research by uncovering the effects of subject-specific methods courses and fieldwork on the development of teacher knowledge and lesson planning practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:51Z (GMT).

First, dominant modes of science teacher professional development have been inadequate in helping teachers create learning environments that engage students in the practices of science, as called for most recently by the NGSS. Second, there is a lack of teacher presence and voice in the national dialogue on education reform and assessment. In this study, teachers led and participated in a professional community focusing on STEM education research. In this community, teachers became increasingly responsible for designing and enacting learning experiences for themselves and their colleagues. We investigated the characteristics of the science teachers' learning process. Findings suggest that teachers who participated in this model generated knowledge and practices about teaching and learning while simultaneously developing identities and practices as education reform advocates and agents of educational change.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:52Z (GMT).

This paper introduces an analytic tool called classroom discourse analyzer (CDA) to address these difficulties, as shown in the analyses of classroom discourse from a fourth grade science class. The analyses demonstrate how CDA can be used by teachers to support their reflection on classroom talk and how it can provide personalized, data-supported evidence to inform teachers' classroom practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:53Z (GMT).

In order to understand how collaborative problem solving discourse shapes the creativity of collaborative products (as measured by the novelty of those products), we analyzed collaborative problem solving talk and the resulting products designed for fictional character by 9 groups of middle- school aged youth.

Specifically, in the secondary science teacher preparation program teacher educators adopted a practice- based focus in which secondary pre-service science teachers participated in the high-leverage practice of engaging students in task-based science discussions and the planning of those discussions. The results suggest that pre-service teachers are able to incorporate aspects of these instructional models in their discussion planning practices. The results also suggest a shift in focus on different aspects of planning over time and across science disciplines that open the possibilities for future work.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:54Z (GMT).

In many cases these progressions describe multiple `big ideas' or constructs. Relationships between these constructs, i.e., how development along one might affect the other, are difficult to ascertain. Such relationships can be described from the perspectives of either item characteristics or student abilities. Existing methods of analyses focus predominantly on the `item-side' of the equation and much less research addresses construct relationships from the `student-side'. In this study, we supplemented a Multidimensional Item Response Modeling approach with a Latent Class Analysis to more fully explore both within and between-construct relationships. We analyzed student written responses (n=317) to 31 ordered-multiple-choice items targeted at five constructs in a genetics learning progression. We present our finding with the goal of comparing and contrasting the types of inferences that can be made with both measurement approaches.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:54Z (GMT).

Students are also expected to understand the epistemic grounds and norms that accompany these practices. We report on a study in which we engaged middle school teachers, and their students, in model-based inquiry, with particular emphasis on developing models and evaluating competing models using evidence. Analysis of students' written arguments, in the context of an assessment task in genetics, suggests that students use both secondary epistemic criteria, relating to communicative features of models (labels, drawings), as well as primary epistemic criteria, relating to evidence-model fit. Most students used at least one, and often several, provided pieces of evidence to support their arguments. We also discuss some instructional implications and tradeoffs in selecting evidence for such model generation and model evaluation tasks.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:55Z (GMT).

The approach taken to foster this transfer depends on the diagnosis of why this transfer can fail in the first place. Although a common diagnosis focuses on content knowledge and problem features as explanatory, there exist other, less prevalent diagnoses for why transfer across disciplines fails. In this paper, we show how one student responds differently to two similar problems set in physics and calculus problem contexts. We argue that beyond a content knowledge diagnosis, an epistemology diagnosis and an accountability diagnosis can also plausibly contribute to an explanation of why this student approaches these two similar problems differently, presenting additional considerations in fostering interdisciplinary transfer.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:56Z (GMT).

The group with a more successful model and more coherent final explanation judged their own work against scientific norms explicitly throughout their building process, while the less successful group remained focused on social and academic norms as they evaluated their work. When students explicitly invoked particular norms, subsequent arguments tended to coalesce around the explicitly identified norm. Particular strategies for dispute resolution aligned students with either scientific or social academic norms. We suggest the need to make norms and the negotiations around norms visible for students and to encourage science students to use scientific norms when evaluating their work.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:56Z (GMT).

There are ad- vantages to this integration, for both engineering and literacy goals of instruction: The stories provide ""clients,"" to support students' engagement in engineering, and understanding clients' needs involves close attention and interpretation of text. Results are encouraging, but mixed, in part for variation in how students frame the task. For instance, while students often pay close attention to the stories, interpreting and anticipating their fictional clients' needs, they sometimes focus more on the teacher and what they think she would like to see. This variation occurs both within and across groups of students, and it motivates studying the dynamics of student framing. Here we examine two students' stability in framing their work as nascent en- gineers.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:57Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This study was designed as a follow-up study after a four-year professional development program that emphasized an argument-based inquiry approach. Data sources included 30 science lessons focusing on whole-class discussion from three early elementary teachers' classes. Data were analyzed through constant comparative method and enumerative approach. The findings indicated: (1) teachers used multiple roles in establishing argumentative discourse as they persistently implemented an argument-based inquiry approach, (2) as teachers used multiple roles in establishing patterns of questioning, framing classroom interaction, students' higher levels of cognitive thinking was promoted, and (3) as teachers' patterns of questioning changed, the frequency of students' talk increased and the dialogical interaction between students and teachers became more evidence-based and connected.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:57Z (GMT).

In prior work, we found that when providing verbal justifications, learners' speech patterns predict whether their justifications are mathematically sound. However, current views on the embodied nature of cognition suggest that actions and speech may co-constitute reasoning processes. The current study investigated whether the gestures learners use while formulating proofs also predict proof validity. 120 undergraduates provided verbal justifications for two mathematical tasks. We analyzed speech patterns in participants' justifications using text analysis software, and we coded participants' gestures as dynamic or static. Results showed that dynamic gestures were correlated with mathematically valid proofs and with specific patterns of speech. A stepwise logistic regression model found that speech and gesture separately account for unique variance in a model predicting proof validity, indicating that gesture contributes to mathematical reasoning in an abstract task domain.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:58Z (GMT).

The program utilizes the school library, new media activities, and science fiction to engage young people to imagine STEM as relevant in their lives. We focus our analysis on two African-American boys, Damian and Jamal, who are best friends and avid gamers. Despite their similar backgrounds, they show starkly divergent identity trajectories while participating in our program.

One such example that many creators determine is the amount of story to embed in an educational game. To learn more about the importance of story in educational games, 77 fourth grade students in one elementary school were randomly assigned to play one of three versions of an educational video game with varying levels of story. The goal of the videogame is to give students practice with fractional-whole operations. In addition to logging interactions students made during gameplay, pre and post-tests that capture students' fractional knowledge in a classroom environment are reported and discussed. Results indicate that while story may not seem to be a critical factor in improving learning, its benefits and impact on learning may be more nuanced and complex.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:42:59Z (GMT).

All activities were designed according to the Knowledge Community and Inquiry (KCI) model, which guides the design of collective inquiry curricula where students make progress as a knowledge community with explicit connections to learning expectations. The paper applies Chinn's EC framework to the design and enactment of EvoRoom and, by extension, to the KCI model. Findings reveal a shift in students' perceptions of ""sources of knowledge,"" however students' ""justification of knowledge"" was seen to be compromised in cases where students satisficed their original epistemic stance in favor of group consensus.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:00Z (GMT).

In this study, we focus on the learner by exploring the possibility that when learners align their actions and beliefs with expansive framing, they are more likely to transfer knowledge from one context to another. We define expansive framing as the perspective that learning is connected to other times, places, participants, and topics, and that the role of students is to generate and share knowledge. We examine the degree to which high school biology students aligned themselves with this perspective. Using correlational and discourse analyses of students' performance on transfer assessments in relation to their perceptions of the expansive relevance of their class, we present evidence of a relationship between alignment with expansive framing and transfer. Students who perceived greater temporal relevance across past experiences, current learning, and future opportunities displayed the highest levels of transfer.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:01Z (GMT).

This paper examines a cultural historical approach to Making and Tinkering at two sites of El Pueblo Mgico (EPM), a social design experiment that joins university students, researchers and k-8 youth from predominately non-dominant communities together in joint activity for expansive and consequential learning (Gutierrez &amp; Vossoughi, 2010). In the lineage of design experiments in the learning sciences our work addresses what Resnick and Rosenbaum discuss as the critical importance of designing contexts for tinkerability from a theory-based and iterative design approach that aims to both understand and change practice. With our work we seek to re-mediate normative STEM learning contexts for youth from non-dominant communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Cognitive researchers rarely consider motivational processes, and interest researchers rarely consider cognitive process. However, it is essential to consider both since achievement and interest are in fact intertwined. In this paper we (1) discuss a theoretical model that intertwines cognitive and interest development, (2) describe how that model informed the development of educational materials, and (3) report on the results of the motivational components of a randomized research study examining the impact of text genre on interest. We hypothesized that students with low levels of interest would receive greater benefit from narrative text formats, whereas students with high levels of science interest would benefit more from expository text formats. The results of this research showed the opposite effect. Students with high levels of interest perceived the narrative texts as more interesting and useful for learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:03Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The aim of the current study was to provide a close observation of spontaneous sourcing practices while reading conflicting online information sources, to examine the relation between sourcing while reading and subsequent argument construction, and to assess the role of epistemic perspectives, topic interest, and topic knowledge in sourcing. 61 university students thought aloud while reading four blog-posts that provided conflicting accounts of a socio-scientific controversy. The findings revealed a wide range of sourcing practices. High sourcing participants made more sourcing activities, paid more attention to source characteristics, and made source-source comparisons. Higher levels of sourcing were found to be related to subsequent argument complexity. Epistemic perspectives and gender played a significant role in sourcing practices and highlighted their socio-cultural nature.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:04Z (GMT).

Grounded in sociocultural theory, and situated within Nasir's (2012) work, this study draws on a corpus of data that includes weekly observations and interviews over one year, to examine how the M &amp; T activities are socially organized to increase room for feedback, one of the four important aspects of expansive learning contexts (Nasir, 2012). Specifically, I analyze interactions to understand how relationships facilitated by the social organization of the practice of tinkering can be tools in the design of inclusive, equitable learning spaces.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:04Z (GMT).

Within the store and across multiple hubs in this neighborhood, we found six central processes that facilitated change: building relationships, building community, being family, communicating, belonging, and becoming. Additionally, we found that transformational pathways situated in the social, cultural, educational, economical, political, and research realms drove and connected these hubs, creating momentum towards sustainable change. We use the concept of a rhizome to explore how various hubs were connected through these transformational pathways and how redundancy across hubs created new developmental trajectories for community members. Looking across hubs, we found that transformational processes were generated when multiple and divergent discourses were intentionally allowed to remain in tension, rather than being compelled into consensus (creating what we call spaces of dissensus).","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:05Z (GMT).

The methods used in this paper may contribute to more effective ways of assessing the quality of discourse in socio-technical environments and the findings provide potential models for using social media as new contexts for developing conceptualization and discourse practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:06Z (GMT).

The need for a new notion and model emerged from a longitudinal study of communities in higher education that, among others, aimed to explore the communities' design principles and stages of development. The characteristics of emergent communities in an educational setting were not fully congruent with either CoP or CoL and their theoretical principles. This paper delineates the need for an emergent notion and model, termed ""community of learning practice"", which incorporates elements from both CoP and CoL, but simultaneously aims for balance between emergence and design in an educational setting to an extent that allows communities to grow through members' voluntary participation and negotiated community structure.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:06Z (GMT).

We test two forms of visualization: dual animation depicting both the student's graph and the correct graph in terms of a narrative context and single animation depicting only the student's graph. Quantitative results indicate that both forms of animation supported understanding, but dual animation facilitated construction of more accurate graphs earlier in the unit. Case studies reveal unique graphing patterns associated with each form of animation.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:07Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

While both teachers ventured beyond their comfort zone to provide more opportunities for student interactions and explorations, the enacted implementations reflect differences in the learning goals they targeted and their knowledge of practice. Visualizations of learning analytics did not trigger further exploration among teachers, though these reveal strong links between learning outcomes and the enacted curriculum.

We mapped the design trajectory proposed by Sandoval to capture the complex process of design research. The design trajectory map develops Sandoval's conjecture mapping in two ways, with the capacity to capture movement along the trajectory. We apply the proposed mapping to a well-known design study that described the design history of an inquiry-based learning project. The limitations of the proposed mapping approach are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Despite having a reputation for being nothing at all, close examination of social silence reveals various kinds of silence, arising under different conditions, playing a variety of roles in the temporal order of social interaction. What distinguishes one silence from another? For instance, why are some moments of silence experienced as uncomfortable and others as unremarkable? Here I introduce a conceptual framework for describing a variety of social silences, built on the work of conversation analysis and an ethnographic study of silence in the religious practices of Quakers. A focus on social silence naturally makes the unspoken dimensions of interaction salient and offers new confirmation for the view that face-to-face learning and communication are always partly constituted by embodied (non-verbal) actions. The included framework, descriptions and empirical data serve as platform for two theses: 1) calibrating to the acoustic environment is a basic way that individual behavior is situated in its social context; 2) group silence regulates collective attention by directing it to the present moment of social interaction.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:09Z (GMT).

Our reflection on applying PD in the learning sciences suggest a more democratic and effective methods for objectives such as: defining research and learning goals, practices that consider multiple participants in design, practices for establishing participatory living labs for design research, developing infrastructure for sustainable participation, and using PD as a way to seek transferable rather than generalizable outcomes. Finally, we reflect on how PD might help us answer some of the issues with interest driven learning that motivated our work.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:09Z (GMT).

We focus on the changes in participation as such changes pertain to scientific practices of argumentation, modeling, and experiential, imaginative, and mechanistic reasoning strategies.

We argue that teachers should be provided with opportunities that can support them to make sense of the ways in which teachers' actions can be consequential for the level and type of thinking in which students engage. In this paper, we examined how the use of contrasting video cases can support participants' learning to identify the ways in which teachers' actions shape students' opportunities to think and reason during their engagement with cognitively complex instructional tasks. Qualitative analysis of two sequential professional development sessions revealed that contrasting video cases supported participants' productive discussions about teacher's pedagogical actions and the ways that these actions shaped how students work on cognitively demanding tasks.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:10Z (GMT).

The findings analysis of the two cases that both teachers used a variety of external and internal resources during their planning.

The present paper focuses on the culminating smart classroom activity, where students use the community knowledge base to scaffold their solving of ill-structured physics problems involving popular Hollywood movies. We examine the efficacy of the tools and the environment, including software agents and data mining approaches that serve to define S3, and help orchestrate the flow of activities, materials, and students during the activity's enactment.

In our work with a variety of settings, we have found that young artists' progress depends on their engagement in all of these tasks, and that analysis of this work depends on looking across and through these varied practices. While typical descriptive analyses of such processes move forward, we have found that moving bidirectionally--from final product backward and from initial idea forward--better helps us to understand participants' learning. We use examples from two creative production contexts to describe a technological tool developed for bidirectional artifact analysis by outlining its features, affordances, and constraints.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:13Z (GMT).

Here, we report on a controlled experi- ment comparing how students learn about the emergent topic of diffusion from self-explaining vs. from reading. In contrast to a prior study that found self-explanation was not associated with learning about emergence, students learned significantly more in the self-explaining con- dition. To shed light on how different types of self-explanations are related to learning, we analyze the content of students' explanations and their association to learning outcomes; we also present qualitative analysis of students' misconceptions and how these relate to existing theories of emergent attributes.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:13Z (GMT).

In this paper we propose a collaborative approach to programming, the programmers' collective, that builds on collaborative models found in do-it-yourself (DIY) and open source communities. We describe and analyze the work of a class of high school student collectives engaged in programming music video mashups as part of a collaborative challenge in the online Scratch community. Our multi-level analysis focused on students' learning of specific programming concepts, effects of collaborative and task design on learning, and their personal reflections. In the discussion we address how students' experiences point to the value of ""nested collectives,"" or multiple levels of designed-for collaboration as well as a needed shift from a focus on computation to computational participation.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:14Z (GMT).

Constructionist activities have always been part of the larger gaming ecology but have traditionally received far less attention than their instructionist counterparts. We argue that constructionist gaming approaches promote not only meaningful content and collaboration but also creative and critical skills in the context of coding. We propose that future discussions of serious gaming ought to be inclusive of constructionist approaches to better realize the full potential of gaming as a means to genuinely connect children to technology and to each other and how this potential for more meaningful connectivity can address the persistent access and diversity issues long facing gaming cultures.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:14Z (GMT).

In the case of the Bifocal Modeling activities discussed here, a group of high-school students designed computer models of bacterial growth through reference to a physical experiment they were conducting, and they were able to validate the effectiveness of their model against the results from their experiment. Our findings suggests that as students compare their virtual models with physical experiments, they encounter ""discrepant events"" that contradict their existing conceptions and elicit a disequilibrium. This experience of conflict encourages students to further examine their ideas and hypothesis, seek more accurate explanations of the observed natural phenomena, improving the design of their computer models.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:15Z (GMT).

""Deep hanging"" entails authentic tasks in rich contexts, providing access, capitalizing on opportunity, and building interpersonal relationships. Data include reconstructive history interviews with mentors and video of their interactions with youth in the afterschool program. The conceptual framework for this paper explores the ways that constellations of situated events lead to changes in sociomaterial practices overtime. Findings suggest that surfacing and exploring mentors' self-position with respect to STEM is crucial to understanding how they will position youth. These findings have implications for the design of learning environments that seek to broaden participation for non-dominant groups in the sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:16Z (GMT).

However, some forms of scaffolding may overload novice-students' cognitive capacity or short-circuit productive exploration of the problem space. Hence, we evaluate the effectiveness of scaffolding in a virtual simulation in physics, considering students' attitudes and prior knowledge. 100 undergraduate students completed either a scaffolded or a relatively unstructured activity, followed by another unstructured activity. While the given scaffolding was beneficial for students with high prior knowledge, it did not assist students with low prior knowledge. Furthermore, the scaffolded activity increased students' attitudes towards memory-and-recall in a way that transferred to the later unsupported activity, where these goals were no longer appropriate. Last, prior knowledge did not contribute to learning outcomes in the presence of intuitive grounded feedback. We explain these results in terms of productive failure and cognitive load.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:16Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We propose a theoretical construct, metaphorically termed the internal metric for certainty in explanation, to account for the process of internal evaluation. We suggest that the internal metric is multidimensional, and discuss three dimensions: (1) intuition; (2) local coherence; (3) mechanistic reasoning. We argue that these three dimensions are highly active in self-evaluating explanations about phenomena in the physical world. We operationalize these dimensions into empirically traceable terms. We illustrate our framework through an analysis of an episode of a student's reasoning about what causes a plastic bottle to shrink when air is pumped out of it. The analysis demonstrates that the framework can explain conviction in an explanation, as well the preference for one explanation over another.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:17Z (GMT).

This includes expressing scientifically informed ideas, sharing ideas with peers, and evaluating multiple sources of information. Effective instruction builds on students' prior ideas, enables them to benefit from exchanging ideas with others, and supports them learning from one another. How might technology support these exchanges? And how might documenting these exchanges inform teachers' and researchers' improvements to their instruction and design? We describe the Public Idea Manager, a new curriculum-integrated tool that supports students exchanging ideas during web-based science inquiry. Our exploratory analyses show relationships between the diversity and sources of students' ideas and the quality of their explanations. We discuss implications for formative assessment, and for the role of technology in supporting students to engage more meaningfully with information and with each other.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:17Z (GMT).

Partially but not entirely explained by socioeconomic factors, REM underperformance is associated with different and inequitable sociocultural demands between informal and formal settings where REM children learn and develop. ""Culturally responsive"" classroom teaching is posited to help remedy this situation, but conceptual clarity and empirical support are limited. To address these limitations I recommend the learning sciences closely study cultural dimensions of social interactions across diverse classroom settings. Derived from a synthesis of research and theoretical traditions, I present an emergent framework of sociocultural interactions in classroom settings--10 dimensions organized into three domains: Life Applications, Self in Group, and Agency. I describe the constructs and address implications for design research: the need for reliable observation, and stronger theories of classroom settings/contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:18Z (GMT).

This case study follows an Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) in the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) during the 2012-2013 school year as they enacted the data-driven practice of Instructional Rounds (IR). Taking a Cultural- Historical Activity Theory with Institutional Theory framework (CHAT-IT), a discursive analysis of ILT meetings displays the seeming resolution of manifestations of cultural- historical contradictions within the ILT's enactment of the IR practice. Yet, further analysis of and interviews with individual members troubles these resolutions, particularly when seeing IR as a coercive, mimetic, and normative mechanism. As one of few studies adopting the CHAT-IT framework, this case study supports the fruitful, dialogical understanding of organizational learning as culturally and historically situated activity.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:18Z (GMT).

We frame this as a productive tension that will generate new insights, as well as conceptual and methodological tools that contribute to the democratization of learning. We identify a history of ideas inside and outside the learning sciences that inform this objective, including the political dimensions of the field's founding theorists. We then offer examples of ways these tensions manifest in our own empirical work, and conclude by considering how explicit attention to political dimensions of learning can advance our theories about what learning is, about what it is for, and about the conditions that give rise to deep forms of learning for all.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:19Z (GMT).

Nowhere is connected learning more needed than in areas of programming and engineering with new digital technologies, specifically craft technologies, which holds new potential to reshape the ways that we think about these disciplines. Often, discussions of connected learning focus on children and youth with an emphasis on informal, out-of-school settings. We argue college students and adults may benefit just as much from connected learning, and formal settings of learning should not be neglected in conversations of connected learning. We describe and analyze a new university course called Craft Technologies, developed to engage non-engineering, non-computer science major students by creating projects that would change the way they thought of and used computers and electronics.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:20Z (GMT).

Fine-grain analysis of session transcripts, students' written documentation, and videotapes for this single group case yielded a recurrent pattern of within-session behavior and evidence for the group's use of metacognitive knowledge and skills over time as well as salient difficulties.

Increasingly, museums are adopting digital media and technologies in the exhibits both to modernize the experience and to increase visitors' interest, engagement, and learning. This study examines how three dynamic visualizations (digital augmentation, computer simulation, and animation) support visitors' knowledge of a commonly misunderstood scientific concept, Bernoulli's Principle. Data from interviews, surveys, and tests reveal that visitors' knowledge significantly increased after engagement with multiple visualizations. Both children and adults attributed their understanding to the affordance of multiple visualizations to accommodate a range of learning styles and to offer a diverse range of types and depth of knowledge. Based on these findings, we suggest that designing for multiple visualizations in museum exhibits is a positive approach to increasing visitors' understanding of scientific knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:21Z (GMT).

We use a mixed methods design to investigate the comparative impact of embedded visual and written prompts (e.g. curricular scaffolds) on 3rd-grade students' formulation of model-based explanations for the water cycle. Students from six 3rd-grade classrooms generated models of the water cycle during an 8-week water unit. Findings suggest that students in the scaffolded group (n = 120) more frequently represented sequences of water underground than the unscaffolded group (n = 112). However qualitative results indicate the scaffolded group was also less likely to generate model-based explanations from their sequences of `hidden' water processes. We conclude that embedded curricular scaffolds may support students to consider `hidden' components but, alone, may be insufficient for theory building.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:21Z (GMT).

To identify and address students' challenges in ubiquitous learning context, this study takes a longitudinal view to examine students' scientific practices throughout a school year.

Longitudinal, ethnographic data of 14 youth were analyzed with our conceptual framework using constant comparative analysis. Findings indicate different pathways taken by youth. Data also revealed the iterative and on- going movement between a) investigating and b) communicating with and taking action in the community supports powerful learning in conjunction with productive identity work in engineering. The process of figuring out what and how to communicate to others about one's investigation in scientifically rigorous and culturally resonant ways, and in accounting for multiple outside perspectives, is pivotal to both learning and identity development.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:23Z (GMT).

Each student in a group read a different document related to learning environment principles (expert group work). Then, students worked together to integrate the ideas in the documents through discussion (jigsaw group work). We examined the proposed design by analyzing the types of regulation that students used and by interpreting their means of solving social conflicts. Furthermore, the relationship between group characteristics and learning outcomes was explored. Results show that stable engagement in socially shared regulation of learning in the jigsaw group was related to better learning outcomes. In addition, students failed to maintain their socially shared regulation when members had different regulation strategies for solving their social conflicts in groups.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:25Z (GMT).

Using an example lesson from a language arts classroom, we describe the evaluation methodology, consider how analyses revealed potential disconnects between intention and implementation, and discuss how ICAP- based evaluations may advance the design cycle by informing future lesson plans.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:25Z (GMT).

In doing so, they need to engage in sense-making processes to build up conceptual understanding of the connections, and in fluency-building processes to fast and effortlessly use perceptual properties to make connections. We investigate how these learning processes interact, and consequently, which learning process should be supported first. We contrast two hypotheses: (1) conceptual understanding facilitates fluency-building processes, and (2) fluency enhances sense-making processes. We conducted an experiment to investigate whether students learn better if they receive sense- making before fluency-building support, or fluency-building before sense-making support. We assessed students' learning outcomes, problem-solving behaviors, conceptual reasoning, and visual attention. Our results show an advantage for supporting sense-making processes before fluency-building processes rather than vice versa. We conclude that instructional materials with multiple representations should first support sense-making processes and then support fluency-building processes in connection making.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:26Z (GMT).

As such, new educational models have called for learning environments that improve spatial ability. These environments neglect the role of representational competence in supporting spatial thinking in individual STEM fields. This short paper reports a preliminary investigation concerning the unique contribution of representational competence to spatial thinking in the discipline of organic chemistry. Using authentic disciplinary tasks we show that student achievement and response time depends more upon their developing representational competence in chemistry than mental rotation ability and that the format of a disciplinary representation can significantly mediate spatial thinking. Given these findings we argue that new learning environments that target representational competence may be more effective at supporting spatial thinking than those that attempt to train generic spatial ability.","Made available in DSpace on 2019-01-22T19:43:27Z (GMT).

Students of teachers who assumed an active role in engaging students in mathematical conversations away from the cognitive tutor exhibited significant learning gains, whereas students in settings using the cognitive tutor as designed (with limited interaction from the teacher) did not exhibit learning gains.
