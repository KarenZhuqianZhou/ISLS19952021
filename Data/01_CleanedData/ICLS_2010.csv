Or can pictorial illustrations trigger interest and thereby enhance the willingness to learn as suggested by interest theories? Although these approaches seem to contradict each other, we assume that they are compatible: Pictorial illustrations may hamper short-term learning but raise interest and engagement so that in the medium run learning may be enhanced. In order to test our ""integrative"" hypothesis, we explored the potential of different types of pictorial illustrations to trigger situational interest in the context of geometry learning. Results showed an effect of pictorial illustrations on the interestingness of geometry problems. In addition, interest in further learning with the computer-based learning environment was higher with pictorial illustrations than without. On the other hand, interest in deepening geometry knowledge was reduced when illustrations were added.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:19Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Despite this, the learning sciences could benefit from further understanding how the arts offer alternative methods of inquiry, representation, and understanding. At the same time, leaders in the field of arts education are calling for more research in areas that intersect with the learning sciences, pointing to the mutually synergistic ways that the two fields could inform one another. Guided by feminist communitarian methodology, this paper brings together a review of a wide body of research in the field of arts education, spanning affective, cognitive, social, and transformative effects of the arts. Insights are shared for how the arts as a discipline can inform the study of learning and, conversely, point to ways in which learning scientists can contribute to the field of arts education research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:19Z (GMT).

Research in generative design has explored classroom activities that analogize the many participants in a classroom with an often-infinite family of mathematical objects. By contrast, our project focuses on classroom activity structures that support interactions among two to four students, each aligned with different components of a shared mathematical object. In each case, these network-based relationships among students are intended to serve as resources to support learners' efforts to jointly navigate the conceptual territory delineated by their corresponding mathematical relationships in the space of the network. We compare the kinds of exploration of mathematical terrain respectively supported by whole- class and small group activities in classroom networks in order to examine the distinctive learning opportunities provided by each, and consider the potential of these different activity structures for providing mutually supportive instructional experiences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:19Z (GMT).

Third-grade children were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in which CVS was taught via one of the four possible orderings of high or low instructional guidance: (High + High, High + Low, Low + High, and Low + Low). High guidance consisted of a combination of direct instruction and inquiry questions, whereas low guidance was comprised only of inquiry questions. Contrary to commonly held beliefs that high levels of guidance, and in particular, direct instruction, lead only to shallow learning, results show that repeated instances of high instructional guidance were advantageous for both learning and transfer of CVS. Moreover, the High + High group continued to demonstrate strong conceptual understanding of CVS relative to other groups five months after training. Overall the study suggests that strong amounts of instructional guidance are capable of exhibiting powerful effects on children's early science learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:20Z (GMT).

In the study described here, we retested 57 students six months later on constructing unconfounded experiments in a virtual ramp environment, solving problems requiring CVS, and explaining CVS. Collapsing over time, we found that the direct+reify condition had more robust learning than either the direct-no reify or discovery learning conditions on constructing unconfounded experiments. At the delayed posttest, we found a strong trend favoring the direct+reify condition over the other conditions as measured by tasks designing unconfounded experiments starting from a multiply confounded state.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:20Z (GMT).

Through one primary case and two contrasting cases, we examine the interplay among a teacher candidate's orientation to each discipline (math and science), orientation towards discipline-specific teaching, and emerging practices of attending to student thinking in disciplinary domains. This study is of interest because it reveals significant differences between learning to teach science and math, suggesting that practices of attending have disciplinary grounding and therefore do not necessarily transfer across disciplinary contexts. We argue that better understanding these dynamics becomes important for teacher education, particularly for elementary teachers, who are responsible for teaching across disciplines.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:21Z (GMT).

To overcome those challenges learning science researchers have used a variety of methods to help them understand how teachers reason and make decisions while teaching. In this symposium we describe a new digital technology that allows teachers to capture short video clips of classroom activity as they are teaching. The three papers explore different aspects of what we have learned about teacher noticing using this new technology. The first paper describes the potential of the camera to serve as a window into teachers' in-the-moment noticing. The second examines teacher noticing of their students' thinking. The third paper investigates our efforts to use clips captured using this methodology as the basis for video clubs in which teachers watch and discuss excerpts of one another's classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:21Z (GMT).

The spatial representation of numerical magnitude, represented in the form of a mental number line, seems to be of particular importance. Our training program for kindergarten children used a digital dance mat as input device that required children to move their whole body to respond in a magnitude comparison task. By employing such a spatial embodied training method, in a parallel randomized cross-over design, our study with 19 kindergarten children revealed a significant interaction between training condition and repeated exposure to items, implying that children improved more strongly in the dance mat than in the control condition. These results suggest that the use of digital media to train embodied spatial numerical skills may be more effective in basic numerical tasks such as magnitude comparison. We suggest that the involvement of embodied spatial codes, shared by the representation addressed by the task at hand, aids acquisition of task-relevant basic numerical skills.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:21Z (GMT).

In particular, designs of software-based scaffolding as found in web-based Knowledge Forum's scaffold support feature were refined. Analyses of the student discourse data suggests that Knowledge Forum's scaffold supports offer a promising avenue for future design innovations to encourage knowledge building discourse. Results show that students increasingly used the scaffolds to focus their reading and writing of notes over iterations of the study. The proportion of scaffolds for knowledge building discourse increased during each iteration with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of scaffolds for expressing an opinion in the second iteration. Finally, notes with scaffolds contained significantly more words than notes without scaffolds, suggesting that scaffolds promoted more student reflectivity.

The design involved augmenting knowledge-building inquiry with reflective assessment Students wrote reflective summaries to track their initial understanding and trajectories of growth toward scientific understanding in the domain of electrochemistry. Two classes of 10th grade students in Hong Kong participated in Reflective Assessment (RA) and Reflective Assessment with Scaffolds (RAS) conditions. Results indicated that both classes improved on conceptual-change and epistemic-beliefs measures; the effects were stronger for the class with scaffolds. Qualitative analyses showed how students' reflective assessment and collaboration helped them to develop metaconceptual and epistemic awareness as they examined their own and others' understanding. A path analysis indicated that students' engagement on Knowledge Forum predicted reflective collaboration that in turn exerted effects on their changes in conceptual understanding and epistemic beliefs.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:22Z (GMT).

This paper examines the ways that elementary school students are positioned and position themselves during activities aimed at promoting reflexivity about small-group math discussions. We examine one student group's participation in three such activities over eight months' time and specifically highlight the role of a mediating tool that was designed to support participation-centered rather than ability-centered conceptions of learning. Our aim is to examine how one focal group's math discussions were or were not shaped by the tool in ways that were consequential for productive collaborative engagement.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:22Z (GMT).

This study focuses on twenty-four parents who discussed the activities that they engage in to help their children learn about engineering during hour-long interviews. The intergenerational transmission of knowledge that is described in the interviews is analyzed through 1) social structural and cultural analysis, and 2) a case study. We find that parents teach children what they perceived as engineering knowledge, which is not necessarily true but rather subjective, and believed to be a fact based on the parent's other forms of knowledge learned in the past. Understanding this will help us look at engineering education from a new perspective, and the application of this understanding could be used to help provide non-engineering parents alternative ways to support their wish to explore engineering knowledge with their children.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:23Z (GMT).

Through close microanalysis we compare these activities as learning arrangements (Stevens, Satwicz &amp; McCarthy, 2008), considering how they allow for or constrain children's entry into scientific activities, as well as the particular opportunities for learning they may afford.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:23Z (GMT).

Designing effective technology-based learning environments to facilitate learning about complex knowledge domains is more challenging. To a large extent, the key to the puzzle lies in identifying which scaffolding strategies are more effective; and under which conditions. In a simulation-based inquiry-learning environment, this controlled study investigated the effect of two promising scaffolding strategies; question prompts and system dynamics model progressions, on ninth-grade biology students' cognitive regulation and complex problem- solving skills. For simpler complex problems, findings suggested that both scaffolding strategies were equally effective. However, as the problems increased in complexity, system dynamics model progressions were significantly more effective for facilitating both cognitive regulation and complex problem-solving skills.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:24Z (GMT).

We consider how speakers and hearers produce, take up, and re-use gestures to support explanation and conceptual formation in expert-to-non-expert conversation. The study suggests that in face-to-face, one-on-one interaction gesturing plays an important role in facilitating the joint achievement of new conceptual understanding for novice learners. We believe that the gestural practices used to explain complex concepts in informal interactions can be profitably extended to the teaching and learning of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in other learning arrangements such as the classroom.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:24Z (GMT).

We report on two iterations of Micros and Me, focusing our analysis on two design issues: (1) how we attempted to broaden the definition of what counts as school science through a self-documentation task, and (2) how the self-documentation task problematized the conception of ""culture"" in each of the classrooms.

Achieving this goal, however, has proven to be a difficult endeavor. Many learners see science as useful only in school, and they face difficulties connecting science to the real world and to their own interests and goals. In our research project, Kitchen Science Investigators, we aim to start with learners' interests and goals in cooking. We then help them connect cooking to science, using play to help them see food as an object of investigation. We then transition learners into engaging in authentic scientific practices. In this paper we present three cases that highlight scientifically meaningful experiences for KSI learners and the ways play, facilitation, and artifacts bridge the gap between their interests and scientific practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:25Z (GMT).

They transitioned through 7 different representations of their models and their discourse and model-building practices evolved. The findings of this study are framed in terms of Sfard and Laive's (2005) ideas about the objectification of discourse as a definition of learning. The findings from this study are used to demonstrate the power of this perspective and to illustrate that the learning of disciplinary knowledge resulted from the students objectifying their discourse away from the self and its communication with other people and toward the self in relation to the human-independent world of magnetic phenomena.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:25Z (GMT).

Many formative assessment approaches elicit students' prior knowledge without identifying the sources of their misconceptions. This proposal presents a framework that guides the development of formative assessment to measure student understanding of physical science topics using three types of connections. Particularly, we assess how students link physical states, processes and mechanism, integrate different scientific models, and connect scientific knowledge to everyday experience. Based on this framework, we construct sample items on sinking and floating and piloted the items with 18 preservice middle grades science teachers. Analyses of student responses to these sample items provide evidence of the effectiveness of the framework in extracting information valuable to improve learning and instruction. Criteria and implications of using this formative assessment framework in science classrooms are then discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Coordinating verbal (i.e. speech, voice inflection, and word emphasis) and non-verbal (i.e. body orientation, eye gaze, and gesturing) behavioral data, we characterize three patterns that reappeared with stability throughout a fourteen-day, inquiry-based instructional module on the water cycle. We argue that each of these behavior patterns suggests a distinctive way the teacher frames her instruction. We label these frames as: (A) moving towards content objectives; (B) promoting a student-centered discussion; and (C) making sense of students' ideas. The episodic manner in which these frame shifts occur in the classroom suggests a way of conceptualizing a learning progression in teachers' ability to attend and respond to student thinking.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:27Z (GMT).

However, in the universities of Taiwan, laboratory courses often last only a limited time and explore only a single topic of inquiry. Students' individual ideas and experiences are not well represented in the group inquiry process. Therefore, this study attempts to provide an organizing tool on PDAs to help student groups regulate their inquiry processes and engage in reflective inquiry activities.By gathering data from 56 students (17 groups) participating in the laboratory course, this study utilizes handheld devices as an observational tool for peer interactions in collaborative inquiry activities. A total of 360 minutes of activity log was analyzed for details of peer interaction in order to understand how handheld devices can influence group regulation when students are provided with group regulation functions on PDAs. Students demonstrated six main types of interaction when formulating group inquiry plans via PDAs. This study makes distinction between four patterns of cooperative PDA use. Such distinction could assist teachers and system designers in facilitating group activities by avoiding unfavorable interaction patterns. The results show that unperceived conflicts concealed in individual devices impede peer interaction. This finding suggests that designers of learning environments should consider the importance of reinforcement mechanisms applied in Mobile Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (MCSCL) to maintain shared understanding. Keywords: Laboratory courses, group regulation, handheld devices, peer interaction analysis 1. Introduction The laboratory course follows an inferential curriculum designed to foster science inquiry ability in science education (Hinrichsen &amp; Jarrett, 1999; Hollingworth &amp; McLoughlin, 2001). Students in laboratory courses learn how to pursue scientific knowledge through inquiry and experience the process of constructing such knowledge (Edelson, Gordin, &amp; Pea, 1999). Within the inquiry process, students formulate testable hypotheses, measure variables, and design experiments. However, in current practice, the design and implementation of laboratory courses is based on an instructional rather than hands-on approach (Mayer 2004; Kirschner, Sweller , &amp; Clark, 2006), i.e., students complete experiments step by step according to the textbook or an instructional manual provided by the teacher. Such an approach deprives students of the opportunity to experiencethe reflective inquiry process and to learn how to acquire knowledge through that inquiry process in laboratory courses and settings. Collaborative inquiry has recently come to be considered an effective mode of reflective scientific inquiry. Students can actively develop problem solving and knowledge construction activities during peer discussion and interaction (Blumenfeld, Marx, Soloway, &amp; Krajcik, 1996; Littleton &amp; Hakkinen, 1999). Peer discussion and interaction can facilitate social construction of knowledge (Jonassen, 1994) that cannot easily be attained through individual inquiry learning.However, laboratory courses often last onlya limited amount of time and explore only a single inquiry topic. For example, laboratorycourses in the universities of Taiwan consist only of weekly 3-hour classes covering a single topic. Students' individual ideas and experiences are not well represented in the group inquiry process due to time limitations. Thus, students may fail to get the opportunity to exchange ideas and experiences with peers. Furthermore, previous studies have confirmed that students still have difficulty formulating testable hypotheses, designing conclusive experiments, and compiling compatible data (Manlove, Lazonder, &amp; De Jong, 2006). In order to achieve effective reflective scientific inquiry, student groups need regulative support in collaboratively forminginquiry strategies. Therefore, it is necessary for laboratory courses to provide an organizing tool to help student groups regulate their inquiry processes and conduct reflective inquiry activities. Prior to this study, researchers (Manlove, Lazonder, &amp; De Jong, 2006) had developed some regulative learning tools on handhelds designed to help students with collaborative development of inquiry strategies; handhelds had become increasingly affordable in classrooms over the course of recent years (Roschelle, 2003; Zurita &amp; Nussbaum, 2004; Liu et al., 2006; Fry &amp; Hin, 2006; Liu &amp; Kao, 2007), and increased student participation and collaboration in classrooms had been experimentally facilitated by means of handheld devices. However, although students could use handhelds as regulative tools in their pursuit of knowledge, they had difficulty generating a complete group experience in the limited time available. They could not easily exchange experiences with peers due to lack of individual inquiry experience. Therefore,this study designed an inquiry learning activity which integrated in-class discussion of inquiry planning using PDAs with pre-class regulation of inquiry planning. Students could organize individual exploration plans on the web to build individual inquiry experience in advance. At the laboratory, handhelds were adopted as a group regulation tool to help students organize and discuss their group inquiry plans based on their individual inquiry plans. This study attempts to bridge the gap between individual and collaborative construction of knowledge in order to promote efficiency and effectiveness in science laboratory courses. This study attempts to understand how handheld devices can influence group regulation when students are provided with group regulation functions on PDAs. Recent research methodologies in Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) have put significant emphasis on the micro analysis of peer interaction, through which improvement of learning may take place (Stahl, Koschmann, &amp; Suthers, 2006). This study not only takes into consideration the performance gain resulting from technologies but also attempts to uncover the reason why the technology improves the interactions that lead to meaningful learning (Liu et al, in press). Accordingly, this study uses micro analysis to explore the interaction demonstrated by student groups using the group regulation","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:29Z (GMT).

This is a challenging task particularly for preservice teachers who may not have experienced inquiry learning, and who do not posses a large repertoire of teaching strategies, or knowledge of student thinking in the domain. Here we report on the development of preservice teachers' lesson designs in the context of a two-year certification program with four consecutive methods courses. These courses included multiple opportunities to plan and implement inquiry-based lessons and units. We analyzed the lesson-designs of 15 preservice teachers. These lessons were generated as part of clinical interview conducted at the end of each course. Analysis of lessons revealed growth in the teachers' ability to: (a) craft appropriate questions to gather students' preconceptions and drive inquiry lesson, (b) anticipate students' prior knowledge and attend to the broader context of the curriculum, and (c) create more relevant investigations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:29Z (GMT).

This study examines how the participant structures and discourse moves of students engaged in collaborative learning affect their justifications. Forty students working on Knowledge Forum, an on-line collaborative learning environment, posted 136 messages, which were coded and analyzed with an ordered logit,vector autoregression, system of equations. When students disagreed or made claims, they were more likely to use evidence. After a studentmade an alternative claim, the next student posting a message was less likely to use evidence. When students made claims, disagreed, disagreed with other's justifications, or read more noet s, they were more likely to use explanations. Boysmade more claims than girls did, but otherwise, they did not differ significantly in their likelihood of using justificatio.nTogether, these results suggest that participant structures and discourse moves are linked to justifications.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:30Z (GMT).

We wonder how these two perspectives could be combined, in order to provide a coherent and illuminating analysis of the learning and to have something to say about the transactional and progressive processes towards `being a competent learner' and `being a scientist' that might be at work here. We have found the notion of `resourcefulness' to be a useful boundary object; it works differently in the different lenses, but has core features in common. We look back across three documented learning episodes and teacher reflections from an early childhood centre, and consider ways in which `resourcefulness' can provide a boundary-crossing concept that has value for discussions about learning across educational sectors.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:30Z (GMT).

This paper presents a series of four studies conducted to examine: What texts are a regular part of videogame play? What is their nature, function, and quality? And what is the nature of adolescent reading performance within such contexts? Our results show that informational texts, comprised of 20% academic language and with an 11.8 average reading level, are the most prevalent text type used for gameplay. Reading performance on such texts is no different than on school-related texts when topic and difficulty were controlled. However, when struggling readers when allowed to choose the topic, they performed at ""independent"" level (94-97% accuracy) even on texts that were 7-8 grade levels above their head.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:30Z (GMT).

The underlying assumption was that group performance can be positively influenced by making group members aware of how their social and cognitive behavior is perceived by themselves, their peers, and the group as a whole. Participants were 120 fourth-year high school students working, with or without the tools, in dyads, triads and groups of 4 on a collaborative writing task. Results show that groups using tools perceived their team as being better developed, experienced higher levels of group satisfaction and lower levels of conflicts, than groups not using the tools. Results demonstrate that awareness, stimulated by peer assessment and reflection tools, enhances the social performance of a CSCL-group.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:30Z (GMT).

This study explored the impact of a curriculum that integrated hands-on activities with digital content from two public television shows aimed at introducing preschoolers to science, Peep and the Big Wide World and Sid the Science Kid. Impact was measured using parent reports of 398 low- income children's science talk using a random assignment design, where preschool teachers were assigned to implement either the media-rich science curriculum or a literacy curriculum. Results indicated that the science curriculum had a positive impact on caregivers' reports of children's talk about science.

Over eleven 90-minute lessons students investigated and evaluated scientific data relating to the cultivation of genetically modified plants. The analysis of pre- and post-tests on students' conceptual understanding of Biotechnology topics and their skills in evaluating the credibility of evidence revealed learning gains and suggested that the intervention was successful. Students' written explanations in task-related artifacts and the analysis of two groups' videotaped discussions showed that the students became sensitive to credibility criteria, questioned the sources of data and correctly identified sources of low and high credibility.

A 7- month intervention was designed to provide dense experience in argumentive discourse and to promote meta-level regulation of discourse. Pairs of academically disadvantaged eighth graders conducted electronic dialogs with opposing pairs on a series of social topics. Analysis of intra-dyad discussion over the course of the intervention showed that participants producing a high proportion of meta-level u tterances were more likely to show improvement in argumentive skill. This finding suggests that enhanced meta-level awareness of the strategies and goals of argument, along with rich engagement in argumentation, promote skill development.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:32Z (GMT).

Eliciting and thoughtfully attending to students' thinking in order to help them advance in their learning is no easy matter, however. This study examined how teachers enacted instruction to elicit, connect, and build upon their elementary students' ideas and questions during an innovative twelve-week learner-centered environmental biology unit. The purpose of the study was to identify and describe successes, issues, and challenges related to incorporating students' ideas and questions into science instruction. Primary data sources included field notes taken during classroom observations and teacher interviews. We present three contrasting cases of teachers to highlight evidence that shows teachers' differing strategies for eliciting students' ideas and questions, and for developing students' ideas, questions and questioning skills. We discuss practical implications for designers of inquiry-based science curricula and professional development.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The two classroom teachers were part of a larger study investigating the use of SimCalc in middle school, and their classrooms had learning gains greater than the mean gains for the study overall. Prior analyses documented that these two teachers implemented exemplary classroom discourse practices: they engaged students in discussions with high intellectual work and showed high levels of responsiveness to student statements (Pierson, 2008). Such practices are consistent with both the research on representationally-rich mathematics environments, and instructional practices for students from non-dominant communities. We use transcript excerpts to illustrate these teachers' practices in detail. We found that these two teachers enacted some similar practices, but they also had different teaching styles, different approaches to connecting representations, and different ways of supporting mathematical discussions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:33Z (GMT).

The paper focuses on students' naturally occurring representational practices as identified in an activity of student-generated representations (SGR). The research is based on observations of pairs of students, ages 10-14, generating representations while trying to understand the phenomenon of the moon phases. The activity involves a few stages. First, each student generates a representation to promote his or her own understanding of the phenomenon. Then, the students negotiate and co-construct representations with their peers. Finally, they design representations for explaining the phenomenon to an external audience. The analysis identifies various representational practices utilized by students for making sense of the phenomenon, developing explanations, and communicating their ideas to their peers. The analysis examines how these practices support students in achieving some cognitive and communicative goals.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:33Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Evidence was found for the following perspectives: creation only and compartmental (incompatible models); NOMA, fusion, and complementary (compatible models). Each perspective is related to an approach to learning: rejection of one explanation, switching between explanations instrumentally according to the context, differentiating between areas of reality explained by each, integration of the explanations and refinement of one explanation through the other. Furthermore, students who held compatible perspectives had the potential to engage positively with learning about evolution, those adopting a rejection approach tended to engage with evolution in order to falsify it and the student who took a switching approach demonstrated detached learning. The study therefore provides an example situation in which learning within one discipline affects learning in another.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:34Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Our analysis highlights the methodic ways group members enact the affordances of their situation (a) to visually explore a mathematical pattern, (b) to co-construct shared mathematical artifacts, (c) to make visible the meaning of the construction, (d) to translate between graphical, narrative and symbolic representations and (e) to coordinate their actions across multiple interaction spaces, while they are working on open-ended math problems. In particular, we identify key roles of referential and representational practices in the co-construction of deep mathematical group understanding.

Using discourse-based analysis, we analyzed the data in terms of the teachers' underlying epistemologies and findings revealed significant differences across the three activities. This suggests that (a) teachers' epistemologies might be better understood as finer grained cognitive resources whose activation is sensitive to the context, unlike most research which views them as coherent and stable cognitive structures, and that (b) the research community is far from settling the debate as to what particular approaches should be used to assess or study personal epistemologies.

After presenting distributed creativity as a theory of collaborative creativity based on established principles of distributed cognition, I present the Communities of Innovation framework as a potential representation of distributed creativity. I then discuss a study where phenomenological interviewing (Seidman, 2006) and Critical Incident Technique (Flanagan, 1952), were used to explore the experiences of four members of a graduate community of designers with many characteristics emblematic of COIs. Findings included evidence for the inclusion of some aspects of the proposed COI framework. In addition, I identify challenges and recommendations to establishing a COI within a graduate educational setting and possible new directions for research using a variety of different methods to better understand the nature of COIs and how to effectively develop them.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:35Z (GMT).

These findings are replicated in a physics context. More importantly,a significant disadvantage for concrete representations is identified for some questions. When a problem potentially elicits prior knowledge that is contrary to scientific knowledge, e.g. a scientific ""misconceptio""n, it is found that the concrete representation invokes incorrect answers more frequently than abstract representations. In addition, an interaction is found between the final course grade of the student and the abstract vs. concrete problem format, with higher grade students performing disproportionally better on abstract problems. This is consistent with previous findings in reasoning and an explanation is provided that involves the cuing of familiar, automatic knowledge and skills vs. explicit deliberate processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:36Z (GMT).

However, negotiation between multiple perspectives, interests, practices and traditions intertwines cognitive-epistemic with socio-relational and affective aspects, which may lead to tension and conflict. While tension can disable learning, this paper argues that identifying these tensions should be viewed as a significant source for change and development. The paper reports on a teacher-researcher collaboration at a secondary school which focuses on the co-design of a learning module. It is shown that the identification of tensions during meetings helped participants to focus their efforts on the root causes of problems, which led to a reconceptualisation of the current work practices. This subsequently helped team members to deviate from established norms and improve their practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We describe features of math engaged problem solving and describe how it is value driven. We see multiple kinds of math and multiple people drawn into problem solving, and we identify socially distributed mathematical practices.

The current challenge is to provide professional development (PD) that will be transformative: rather than merely exposing participants to reform instructional materials, it will change what future instructors believe is worthwhile in science education. Our view is that professional development is most effective when it enriches the intellectual life of teachers and builds teacher identity by cultivating concern with student thinking. In an example of an activity that originates in this perspective, participants interview peers about physics concepts and conduct structured reflections on the interviewing experience. The activity holds promise for improving participants' abilities to listen and to teach effectively, increasing their esteem for the intelligence that teaching requires, and increasing their interest in K-12 physical science teaching as a profession.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:37Z (GMT).

The progression foregrounds the question of the fit between organisms and their environment. This paper reports on the first step of the project, our teaching of the curriculum in an urban summer school and the analysis thereof. We analyze students' reasoning during prototype instructional activities and in comparison of pre- and post-interviews. We have had success scaffolding children's understanding of differential survival advantage of different traits. While we have existence proofs of children coming to understand the impact of this differential on changing distributions across generations, this next step of understanding appears to be much more difficult.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:37Z (GMT).

Using the framework of semiotic bundles, we show that reformulating aspects having to do with physics knowledge while moving between talk, gestures, drawings and manipulations is done differently by experts and novices. Analysis of video excerpts illustrate that teachers are able to coherently package multiple sets of signs throughout their discourse and actions in the classroom, but students who are learning physics have specific problems that this framework makes evident. In particular, successfully reformulating from one semiotic resource to another implies that the first resource be correctly constructed. In addition, specific tool affordances hinder students in their attempt to coherently package multiple sets of signs while this is not the case for teachers. We conclude by suggesting ways in which teachers can ease students' difficulties in constructing semiotic bundles.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:38Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

I analyze data on the process of making digital art in terms of the macro and micro tasks performed (Spillane, Halverson, &amp; Diamond, 2001) in order to highlight external representation construction across organizations. Then I describe one micro task in depth to unpack the role the representations created serve in sensemaking.

In this paper, we discuss an exploratory posthoc analysis of 765 workbooks from 48 classrooms that implemented SimCalc. These classrooms participated in a large-scale experiment in which we found that students learned more advanced mathematics in classrooms that implemented SimCalc. A team of three master teachers coded the workbooks for completeness, correctness, and other impressions. We found characteristics of students' work that predict gain scores, including the first evidence that classic SimCalc activities--writing stories and drawing graphs about motions--impact student learning.

The current study revisited motivation to transfer on a sample of 128 participants of occupational health training. Confirmatory factor analysis and partial least square-sbased path modeling were used to test the hypothesized dimensions and relationships among variables inlcuding social and affective cues on training transfer. Based on a combination of the theory of planned behavior, expectancy theory, and self-determination theory, we validated three dimensions of transfer motivation: autonomous motivation to transfer, controlled motivation to transfer, and intentions to transfer. Results indicate that autonomous motivation was affected by attitudes toward training content and utility reactions; controlled motivation was affected by utility reactions, supervisory support,and social norms. Intentions to transfer mediated the effecst of autonomous motivation on transfer three months after training. Implications of a multidisciplinary perspective combining learning sciences and human resource development are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:40Z (GMT).

This study hypothesized and observed evidence for two parallel forms of learning within the Numerically-Driven Inferencing (NDI) paradigm's rather minimalist intervention of providing direct feedback regarding a numerical estimatefeedback that yields remarkably robust cognitive alterations. The present experiment probed the nature of learning apropos recall or estimation improvements observed after participants (a) provided estimates, (b) received feedback, and (c) re-estimated after waiting for one day. The results show that improved estimation/recall was predicted by two independent elementssurprise at feedback and an explicit sense of episodic recall upon testing. This suggests at least two learning processes: (1) an explicit (though perhaps approximate) recollection of a quantity's magnitude and (2) a non- episodic semantic restructuring that correlates with surprise. Thus, even for concise, factual information, we educators might consider students' ""unknown knowns"" knowledge that learners gain without any explicit understanding that they have done so.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:40Z (GMT).

Outcomes indicated that as students developed their concretization skills, they were able to become aware to and reduce gaps between their ""theoretical"" and ""applied"" epistemologies. By making their design ideas more concrete, students were able to carry out productive negotiations about these ideas with instructors and peers, and to explore them in relation to theory and to expert design knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:41Z (GMT).

We investigate whether and how Li made sense of the behavior of an unfamiliar computer-based artifact--the diminishing proportional impact of successive random samples on the overall shape of a dynamically accumulating outcome distribution. Li constructed two informal analogical situations as multimodal discursive means of concretizing, elaborating, and communicating his emerging understanding of the artifact's behavior. These non-routine utterances shifted the discourse to an explicitly embodied, imagistic space bearing unique affordances for negotiated epistemic syntheses of phenomenological and technological constructions of quantitative relations. Microgenetic analysis suggests that Li's presymbolic notion was not a static magnitude but an intensive-quantity ""actionobject""; he subsequently unpacked this dynamical ""a/b"" qualia into its constitutive ""a"" and ""b"" elements. We reflect on implications of this counter-curricular sequence for educational design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, there is no evidence for any identifiable perceptual trait. Nonetheless, the process of developing a good eye in medicine is proposed, indicated, and elaborated by various measures contingent on diverse methodological arenas, all of which attempt to advance our understanding of what constitutes visual cognition in diagnosing medical images. Thepurpose of this paper is to provide a reflection on this methodological pluralism.We first identify four metaphors used in the analysis of visual cognition: activation, detection, inference, and practice. These metaphors are described with an empirical example and discussed to elicit (partly tacit) assumptions associated with prototypical method decision.s We then link the proposed metaphorical mapping to what it implies for current epistemological, methodological, and curricular discussions in medicaleducation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:43Z (GMT).

To this end, they have to exchange and discuss their individual knowledge, which is usually gained through individual exploration of different learning materials. Based on the psycholinguistic concept of lexical alignment, the following study analyzes whether providing learners with different technical terms in their respective learning materials has a positive impact on information exchange, term understanding, and learning. Results showed that dyads whose materials contained different terminology exchanged more information and performed better in a subsequent knowledge test than did dyads whose materials contained the same terminology. The inclusion of illustrations containing different terminology enhanced these effects. Implications for the selection and design of learning materials as well as perspectives for further research are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:43Z (GMT).

Using co-design, the researchers collaborated with three high school science teachers to design a curriculum where 112 grade-ten biology students collaboratively developed a community wiki about Canadian ecozones and biodiversity issues. Students then used the wiki as the primary resource for a subsequent inquiry activity. This paper analyzes students' contributions to the knowledge base, test performance, and student satisfaction to evaluate the efficacy of the KCI model. A new method of analysis for collaborative wiki artifacts was developed to measure student interaction in the wiki. We found that students who were higher contributors to the knowledge base performed better on a post-test than students who were measured as low contributors. Our findings suggest that the KCI model is a promising mechanism for supporting both collaborative and individual learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:44Z (GMT).

Student teachers were interviewed regarding their views on learning and teaching (N = 30). The content analysis shows different multifaceted beliefs. The results reveal an alteration in the beliefs during the studies: At the beginning there is a `transmissive- emotional' focusing which changes progressively to a more cognitive focus including `construction' and `participation', and still `transmission'. Furthermore, the internal structure of `participation' in the views of the interviewees does not correspond with the theoretical concept. On the basis of these results the possibility of developing a questionnaire for closer investigation of `participation' is being discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:45Z (GMT).

However, it remains an open question whether these benefits will extend to other domains like second language grammar learning. Within the domain of the English article system (teaching students when to use a, an, the, or no article at all), we compare two computer-based tutoring conditions in an in vivo classroom study. In the article choice condition, students select the correct article to complete the sentence. In the explanation choice condition, students are given a sentence with the correct article highlighted and choose the rule or feature that best explains the article use. Students (N=101) in both conditions show significant learning on both procedural (article choice) and declarative (explanation choice) tasks. Not surprisingly, we found that declarative instruction (explanation choice) led to significant learning of explanations, while procedural practice (article choice) led to significant learning of the procedures. More interestingly, we also found evidence of cross-type transfer such that declarative practice led to procedural gains and procedural practice led to better understanding of the declarative rules. In general the effects of prompted self-explanation appeared somewhat stronger than those of procedural practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:45Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The study gives an example of the application of a specific model of teaching/learning (the Model of Longitudinal Development) that acted as ""framework for action"" in the design of the learning environment as ""properly complex territory."" The data analysis gives indications for how to develop a theoretical understanding of the concept of ""personal learning trajectory"" and it provides a basis for exploring the factors that can trigger intellectual autonomy.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:46Z (GMT).

In order to fulfill this promise, learning progressions must be developed and refined based upon a rigorous process that explores the match between the learning progression and available evidence of student learning and is complicated by the nature of students' thinking. This paper explores the implications of reframing consideration of learning progressions using Gee's notion of discourse. This reframing is posited as a means of making sense of students' use and interpretation of words that have both everyday and scientific meanings and their apparent inconsistency in responding to assessment items. Data collected about students' understandings relative to two learning progressions is used to explore this approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:46Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Extending previous research, this study investigated verbal interactions within teams of high school students as they solved a prototypical design-task called the Earthquake task. Videotaped performance assessments of high and low performing teams were analyzed in depth. Teams were categorized as high and low performing using two different methods: (1) highest successful structure built and, (2) percentage of successful designs. Results suggest that teams engaged in three different patterns of verbal interactions: Accept-Build, Accept-Build-Discuss- Modify, and Discussion. High performing teams most often engaged in, and were most successful when, their verbal interactions followed the Accept-Build-Discus-Modify pathway. The instructional implications of these results for promoting productive group collaboration and future research directions are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:47Z (GMT).

In this paper, we use the idea of framing to analyze a 42-minute science lesson of a senior kindergarten student-teacher. Findings suggest that the student-teacher struggled for balance between teaching science as implementing a lesson plan, and as attending to her students' inquiry. We use this evidence to suggest that novice teachers can attend to students' inquiry as early as in their student-teaching experience, which suggests additional pressure on the need for preparation in teaching science. Thus, the role of science methods courses should be to help students understand the different interpretations of teaching within the different frames and provide them with strategies for entering more productive frames during teaching.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:47Z (GMT).

Using video data of a heated student-led debate, we show how this student successfully positioned himself with greater authority than recognized adult experts, despite the fact that his evidence was often weak given classroom norms. He was able to do so for two reasons. First, he utilized his role as topic expert to position himself with authority and discredit others, including the recognized adult experts. Second, he drew on student allies that supported his position. We conclude with implications of this paper for how participation structures may mediate the development of powerful student identities, and function in concert with other interactional factors in the classroom.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:47Z (GMT).

Some forums endorse a select learning theory, whereas others do not espouse any one approach. This study shows how student activity differs in a forum that supports Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and one that does not embrace the practice of any single learning theory. A sample of 100 exchanges on the calculus concept of limit were collected from the archives of a forum of each type and compared for student contributions to the construction of the solution and student initiative in expressing resolution. The results show that the forum supporting CLT evidences lower levels of student activity (both initially and following helper intervention), and favors weak over strong expressions of resolution. The designation of the good, bad, and ugly depends on the reader's epistemological stance.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The competitions utilized a web-based environment for designing and enacting collaborative online activities. Since peer assessed team competitions are extremely effective in promoting learning yet are rarely conducted in higher education the study aimed at disclosing students' feelings about such potentially stressful circumstances. The peer assessed competitions were favorably accepted by most of the students who claimed that it improved their performance. Moreover, students level of stress was correlated with putting more efforts into the products and feeling that as a result its' quality improved. In addition, peer assessments were highly correlated with the instructor's assessments and students reported they trusted them regardless the rating received. Finally, Fear of Failure, as a personality trait, predicted which students would report being anxious about the competition. Implications for supporting such students are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

As such, teachers' expertise and learning remain important foci for theoretical development and empirical research. Cultural- historical activity theory (CHAT) has been forwarded as an underutilized but potentially powerful tool for educational research, including teachers' expertise, practice, and learning. However, as yet, little CHAT-based research has been undertaken focused on science teachers and teaching. In this paper, we draw upon two such empirical studies in which CHAT was used as an explicit theoretical and analytical framework to explore CHAT-based perspectives on science teacher learning. We present findings from these studies to highlight important themes in CHAT-based research on science teachers' learning in and from practice. These findings can not only inform programmatic efforts to better promote teachers' learning, but also theoretical perspectives on science teachers' expertise, practice, and learning across the science education and learning sciences communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:50Z (GMT).

We developed a method for representing activity in an experimental online course as workflow expressions. Bielaczyc's (2006) Social Infrastructure Framework (SIF) is utilized to identify important variables, and comprehensive data mining (CDM) techniques are used to recover data from course session modules and activity logs.

Apprentices were asked to perform an authentic workplace task, to explain how they got to the solution and then to comment on a peer's solution. Two conditions of scaffolding were compared: In the high scaffold condition, guiding questions were provided both for explanation and commenting, while in the low scaffold condition, a general instruction was given. The findings showed that, for the first tasks, the high scaffold group outperformed the low scaffold one with regard to the quality of the quotes and self explanations, but that the pattern reversed by the end of the activity. These results show that scaffolding is a useful tool for supporting reflection and learning, but that it should be adapted to the different steps of the activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:51Z (GMT).

We analyzed group dialogue and collaborative and individual concept maps to understand: 1) if convergence of science ideas occurs during collaborative concept mapping and 2) how convergence or divergence during collaboration influences individual map construction. We found that collaborative concept maps facilitated greater convergence of ideas in groups with initially divergent pre individual maps. Further, the negotiation of divergent science ideas during collaboration led to gains in individual students' science understanding.

To foster mechanistic reasoning, we engaged students in the third- and sixth-grades in the design of kinetic toys that consisted of systems of linked levers. To make the workings of these systems more visible, students participated in forms of activity that we conjectured would afford bodily experience of some of the properties of these mechanisms: constraint and rotary motion. Students progressively re-described and inscribed these embodied experiences as mathematical systems. We report a microgenetic study of one case study student, tracing how embodying and mathematizing motion supported the development of reasoning about how levered systems work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:52Z (GMT).

Using data from three different schools participating in TE-PAC2 (Teacher-Parent Collaborative Communities), we find evidence of teacher learning in the stories teachers tell about the meanings of and possibilities for - teacher-parent engagement in the context of broader cultural narratives about the teaching and learning of mathematics and science in their schools and districts. In particular, teacher learning was reflected in changes in teacher narratives over time and in the new understandings of parent resources incorporated into these shifting narratives. We conclude with a proposed trajectory of teacher learning about teacher-parent engagement.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:53Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The software tool, jMAP, was developed to enable learners to individually produce causal maps, download and aggregate the maps across learners. It aggregates learners' maps to reveal similarities between individual/group maps, the percentage of maps sharing particular causal links, average causal strength assigned to specific links, and degree of match between maps of the collective group and target/expert diagram. jMAP produces data to create transitional state diagrams for visualizing how causal maps change over time and the effects of specific dialogic processes. This paper presents findings from two case studies to illustrate how jMAP can be used to support the assessment of causal understanding, and identifies areas for future research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:53Z (GMT).

In secondary education, however, we only see the first signs of transformation in the age of technology and the Internet, and many of these signs are particularly at the administrative level rather than in the classroom. Nevertheless, research, as well as national standards, support collaborative learning and the integration of ICT as an answer to the decreased interest and motivation in science learning and the growing importance that is attached to inquiry skills. This research project deals with the use of web-based collaborative inquiry as a promising approach for secondary science education. In particular, this study investigated the impact of the implementation of a Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE) on students' content knowledge, their inquiry skills and their attitude and engagement towards science. An empirical study in 19 secondary science classes was conducted and 375 students were involved. Additionally, this study focused on gender differences and highlighted the transformation of the teachers' role in web-based teaching. The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of this innovative instructional approach in the attempt of making science accessible and interesting to all and to rectify the gender imbalance in science education.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:54Z (GMT).

Unfortunately little progress has been made towards these goals, because of unresolved methodological issues involved in distinguishing general low math achievement from low math achievement due to MLDs. To address these methodological issues, I conducted a small-scale exploratory study of MLD, which relied on several data sources to ensure that a student's low achievement was due to persistent and debilitating difficulties with mathematics that cannot be attributed to non- cognitive sources. I conducted four weekly video-taped one-on-one tutoring sessions with students focused on the topic of fractions. In this paper I present a case study of one student with MLD. Analysis indicated that the student understood mathematical representations of fractional quantity in atypical ways and this alternative understanding was problematic for the development of more advanced fraction concepts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:54Z (GMT).

Despite the importance of spatial thinking, little is known about the underlying cognitive components of spatial thinking and the strategies that students employ to solve spatial problems. Namely, it is unclear whether students employ imagistic reasoning strategies while engaged in spatial thinking. In the present study, we investigate which strategies students use to solve spatial chemistry problems and the relationships between strategy choice, achievement, spatial ability and sex. The results indicate that students employ multiple strategies that include the use of diagrams and heuristics rather than merely relying on imagistic reasoning. Moreover we observed women to employ strategies differently than men after extended instruction in the domain.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:55Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The method originated in undergraduate chemistry courses, but is now used in math and in other science classes as well. Previous studies have shown that PLTL results in improved student learning in undergraduate chemistry. However, researchers have not studied the group mechanisms and the discourse processes that lead to this improved outcome. This study is one of three inter-related studies that are the first to explore those mechanisms and processes. In this study, we observed videotapes of PLTL sessions and analyzed the discourse of peer leaders and of students.

One possibility to overcome this problem could be a learning partner providing distributed monitoring of the performance of the strategy suggested by the script. In a 2-factorial experiment with the factors fading and distributed monitoring that involved 126 students of educational science we investigated whether during the fading of an instructional script there is a moderating effect of distributed monitoring on the performance of the strategy and thereby on the acquisition of the cognitive skill of argumentation. Strategy knowledge was fostered best by the combination of fading and distributed monitoring. Distributed monitoring also kept the performance of some aspects of the strategy at higher levels during fading, which was positively related to the acquisition of strategy knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:57Z (GMT).

In the journals, students describe their understanding of a topic, its development, and its connection to their lives. The following types of reflections were identified in student journals: action, prior knowledge, project ideas, text resources, classroom events, and monitoring of knowledge. A multiple linear regression analysis of total course points earned versus student GPA, ACT score, number of reflections made for each reflection type, and total number of reflection made throughout all journals was used to determine the significance of the type of reflections made by students in relationship to their chemistry content understanding. The results indicate that students who reflected more on classroom events and those who monitored their knowledge correlated positively with a higher content knowledge. However, reflecting on text resources had a negative correlation to students' overall chemistry content knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:57Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Findings indicate a superiority of a continuous collaboration script compared to unsupported collaboration with respect to both students' online search competence and domain-specific knowledge, whereas the fading collaboration script had a significant positive effect compared to unsupported collaboration only with respect to students' online search competence.

In one class, the unit utilized an embedded design that situated learners within the spatial and temporal extent of the phenomenon during the epicenter determination activities. In the other class, while the activity set remained the same, the embedding features were removed. Students in the embedded condition demonstrated greater learning gains than their non-embedded counterparts in pre- post assessments of student skill, declarative knowledge, and conceptual understandings, even among topics unrelated to the determination of epicenters.

We draw on the epistemological framework of D. Kuhn et al. that delineates three perspectives: absolutist, maintaining that knowledge is objective and immutable; multiplist, maintaining a radical relativism; and evaluativist, maintaining a qualified relativism. We conjectured that typical instruction in the humanities would tend to foster evaluativist views more than typiacl instruction in the sciences. Twenty biology majors and twenty history majors evaluated competing accounts in biology, history and judicial contexts. Structured interviews concerning these accounts were used to assign each participant an epistemologicalview in each discipline. These results were considered in conjunction with learners' reports of their educational experiences. We were disappointed to find that there was an overall tendency toward absolutism. Our main finding is that students are distinguished by major and epistemological view, and that typical history instruction more than typical science instruction seems to foster evaluativist views in history.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:07:59Z (GMT).

It is in this context that, first, we describe an inquiry task intended to provide high school students the opportunity to construct algebraic proofs. Second, as students work on the problem, we map students' inquiry process. More, we identify elements common to students' inquiry process and current views of how mathematics knowledge is constructed. Last, we illustrate the teacher's interventions intended to sustain students' inquiry. Among these, we identified: (1) helping students re-focus their inquiry, (2) helping students select mathematical tools, (3) accepting students' provisory ideas, (4) recognizing the potential in students' ideas and promoting the student to showcase the idea, and (5) reviewing a property using an additional example to preserve the original challenge for students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:00Z (GMT).

As students move to middle and high school, there is little opportunity to learn about, practice, and apply these strategies in classes, particularly in the content domains like science. Nonetheless, there is a growing national consensus that high school content area teachers need to better integrate discipline-specific reading supports throughout the curriculum. We evaluate the effectiveness of an effort to integrate reading comprehension strategies in biology classrooms. Students' independent proficiency with the strategies predicted science achievement, even when controlling for prior reading achievement. These results provide evidence that strategies are effective and practical in intact science classrooms. We discuss the implications of the findings for the design of content-area literacy instruction. Finally, we describe our efforts to refine the design of the strategy supports based on the empirical results.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:00Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The central focus of our own research has been on how teachers and students navigate the epistemological shift from traditional didactic classrooms to classrooms that function as knowledge building communities (Scardamalia, 2002; Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 2006). We ground our inquiry in Ideas First, a design-based research program focused on creating a knowledge building community in science within a Singapore primary school (Bielaczyc &amp; Ow, 2007; Ow &amp; Bielaczyc, 2007, 2008). In Ideas First we view engagement in the disciplinary practices of science through the theoretical lens of epistemic games (Collins &amp; Ferguson, 1993; Morrison &amp; Collins, 1995). In order to support reflective discourse among teachers and students around epistemic game play, we have created a set of dialogic tools centered on specific types of knowledge building moves. We illustrate the design features of the tools and their role in fostering participation in knowledge building communities in science.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:01Z (GMT).

There is growing evidence from this line of work that students' intuitive thinking about physical phenomena is characterized more so by its diversity and flexibility than its uniformity and robustness. This characterization implies that much of the dynamics of students' thinking over short timescales involve processes that stabilize local patterns of thinking, later destabilize them, and allow other patterns to form. This kind of ""change"" may only involve dynamics by which the system of intuitive knowledge settles into various states without changing the system structure itself. I describe a case study in which a group of college students shift their thinking about motion several times during a collaborative learning activity. Instead of focusing on micro-processes of change, I describe these dynamics in terms of mechanisms that contribute to local stability of students' conceptual coherences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:01Z (GMT).

Respondents (n=1,394) completed baseline environmental awareness surveys and 24 respondents participated in the game design process consisting of four workshops and online activities. The game design component was focused on life cycle analysis (LCA) including environmental impacts of engineering design. Observations and artifacts were collected from workshops and interviews were conducted. Results showed that students had a general awareness about environmental issues but lacked awareness about LCA, pollution, and wetlands. Additionally, the participatory game design process showed that students struggled with applying the newly gained understandings of LCA in the game designs. The participatory game design provided a wealth of information on students' understanding and also served as an effective platform for knowledge elicitation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:02Z (GMT).

We demonstrate how learning and knowledge building may occur when people interact with each other, using shared digital artifacts such as tag clouds (that result from social-tagging activities) or wikis. For both technologies, we provide illustrating data from two pilot studies. As an example, we refer to the learning processes that take place while searching for information in tag clouds. In addition, we illustrate processes of knowledge building by referring to users working on a wiki. In conclusion, the differences and similarities between these technologies are assessed, regarding their potential for knowledge building.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:03Z (GMT).

Focusing on the students' speech acts, gestures, and artifact production during their successful collaborative engagement in an algebraic pattern-finding task, I adopt and adapt Radford's (2003) framework to evaluate the quality of each student's actual learning as implicated by their discursive contributions. By analyzing each student's utterances as either ""to"" a semiotic mode (generalization) or just ""in"" the mode, and then overlaying these coded utterances, I show how one student's participation, which appears to mark a developing algebraic command, in fact blinds the teachers to underlying discontinuity in the student's meaning construction. The study illuminates critical tradeoffs in the design and facilitation of collaborative problem solving.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:03Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Biomedical engineering, as a degree program, serves as a legitimate pathway towards engineering and medical school, making identification with engineering particularly contingent. Living narratives provide glimpses into experiences students have in their design course, which aligns more closely with authentic engineering practice than their previous coursework. As a result, the design course is a significant opportunity for students to consider themselves to be engineers. Framed by changes in accountable disciplinary knowledge and navigation (Stevens, O'Connor, Garrison, Jocuns, &amp; Amos, 2008) within the interdisciplinary context of biomedical engineering and the varied goals of students for choosing the major (engineering vs. health sciences), students' identification as engineers emerges as particularly contentious. Leadership and underrepresentation are considered in relation to identification, navigation, and accountable disciplinary knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:03Z (GMT).

The dominant features of CSCL research methodologies were descriptive studies in classroom settings with self-report/questionnaire that were quantitatively analyzed. Yet, studies were quite eclectic in their research method, adopting a variety of research design, data sources and analysis methods, leading to cross-over or hybrid methodologies. Studies of collaborative learning were carried out frequently both in experimental and descriptive studies in lab and classroom settings. Diverse data sources were collected and analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. New techniques for analyzing collaborative processes were also emerging. Still, it appears that the field needs to be more principled in its applications of design-based research. In addition, the field is in need of more diverse and systematic ways to analyze qualitative data in order to take a full advantage of the rich data afforded in CSCL research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:04Z (GMT).

We discuss two types of networks as they relate to online discourse: structural and semantic. The initial findings indicate that the KSV can be used to visualize a Knowledge Forum database, and can provide a fine-grained semantic analysis that may enable teachers and students to locate the key ideas around which collective learning may takes place.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:04Z (GMT).

We found that there were advantages for each type of manipulative, and that virtual and physical manipulatives helped students develop correct understandings of different concepts. We also found that the order the manipulatives were used affected student learning, with students who used real pulleys before the simulation achieving higher scores on questions having to do with effort force, the distance the rope is pulled, and mechanical advantage.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:05Z (GMT).

Spriting is a new technologically- supported composition process that does not require intermediate mediation with a written form. The output of spriting is a talkument. In this paper, results are presented from a design research study of the impact of spriting on the literacy development of children, ages 5-10, at two different schools. In particular, composite composing and editing actions in spriting presage a reversal of some trends seen in written composition, such as older children producing longer compositions. Furthermore, this paper describes early observations of children appearing to make certain literate habits, such as pausing to plan, explicit in spriting in ways they had not learned to do yet in writing. Results suggest that spriting could offer an alternative way to explore extended forms of literacy and habits of mind before a child is able to write.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:05Z (GMT).

We introduced concept mapping as a voluntary exercise in an upper-level undergraduate immunology course. The students were assigned ten concept maps (for which concept lists were provided) at intervals during the semester-long course. We utilized knowledge space theory (Folmagne &amp; Doignon, 1988) to systematically analyze and compare concept maps drawn by students to their instructor's ""expert"" concept maps. Using this novel analysis method, we were able to reveal students' level of understanding of course material, changes in student knowledge across time, as well as identify students' alternative conceptions. We found knowledge space theory a productive tool for systematically analyzing and comparing students' concept maps across time and to expert's concept maps.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:05Z (GMT).

We present detailed analysis of the wiki content created by two groups of students, revealing a positive correlation between students' contribution to collaborative inquiry activities and their achievements in the curriculum.

This paper describes two case studies, in which we consider children's interactions with others while watching television and the ways in which their television viewing influences other parts of their everyday lives. We find that both children actively applied knowledge they obtained from visual media to other contexts. In addition, they both shared their media viewing experiences with others, either by directly teaching others about what they had viewed or by creating new content based on what they had viewed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:08:08Z (GMT).

Wikis, for example, allow methods of collaborative knowledge construction that were very difficult to achieve with previous technologies. Applications of wikis and related technologies (e.g., Drupal and Django) are blooming in every corner of society, influencing the ways in which people learn and exchange with one another. They are also making their way into our research, resulting in new methodological challenges concerning the analysis of collaboratively constructed materials. This symposium will discuss new methods of content analysis in wiki-environments. The symposium includes an international set of presenters from Canada, Belgium and Norway, representing a small but growing research community that are engaged in such investigations.

The contributions are aimed at studying whether concept mapping can be helpful in reaching these goals. Moreover, we intend to provide preliminary guidelines for using concept maps (CMs) as a learning tool in this specific field. For this purpose, we adopt an instructional design perspective that focuses on the issues as (1) what kinds of learning tasks can be successfully promoted by using CMs, (2) what kinds of learning activities need to be stimulated in order to accomplish these learning tasks, (3) how concept mapping supports students in performing the required learning activities, and (4) which additional instructional means can be helpful to increase its effectiveness.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:17Z (GMT).

In this symposium, we present data from online surveys, system log data, and case studies to investigate the practice of university teaching with LMS to provide feedback about how to successfully implement these systems. We examine instructors' and students' attitudes about LMS and their use of these systems at different levels of analysis, looking across many institutions and increasingly narrowing the focus to several specific teaching vignettes. We organize our investigations of how instructors and students value the LMS by examining three types of use: Learner-Content interactions, Learner-Instructor interactions, and Learner- Learner interactions. We identify common themes and differences revealed by our analyses to make recommendations that are intended to improve teaching and learning with these systems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:18Z (GMT).

We report on three analyses of the everyday cultural and social contexts in which parents' and their children's ideas about formal and informal education are developed and applied through educational choices. The research employs a family-centered analytical focus and a cognitive ethnography of learning to examine educational decisions and knowledge about learning opportunities that families use in their homes, at school, and in their communities. Our analyses foreground the role of choice and values in families' everyday lives, their lived histories, and their educational decisions. Implications for better coordinating in-and-out of school learning experiences in light of extended learning pathways are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:18Z (GMT).

To overcome those challenges learning science researchers have used a variety of methods to help them understand how teachers reason and make decisions while teaching. In this symposium we describe a new digital technology that allows teachers to capture short video clips of classroom activity as they are teaching. The three papers explore different aspects of what we have learned about teacher noticing using this new technology. The first paper describes the potential of the camera to serve as a window into teachers' in-the-moment noticing. The second examines teacher noticing of their students' thinking. The third paper investigates our efforts to use clips captured using this methodology as the basis for video clubs in which teachers watch and discuss excerpts of one another's classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:19Z (GMT).

Two papers explored aspects of learning about complex systems in the domains of physics and electricity and of the mathematics of change and variation. The third paper viewed learning from a complexity perspective as an emergent phenomenon, and proposes to compliment traditional quantitative and qualitative methodologies used in learning sciences research with computational agent-based modeling methods. The fourth paper is a ""theoretical case study"" in which an ""ontological network theory"" based on scale free networks is proposed, and then used to reframe the debate in the learning sciences concerning ""coherent knowledge"" versus ""knowledge-in-pieces"" theories of conceptual change. Overall, it is hoped this session stimulated interest in new theoretical and methodological ""lenses"" for understanding the challenges of learning about complex systems and for doing research into learning as complex systems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:20Z (GMT).

Environmental education has failed to address the lived experiences and narratives of youth living in areas most in need of social, political, and environmental change; and little is known how or why youth might position themselves or be positioned as members of the complex ecology of our changing environments. These papers report on the role of place by looking at the way it is manifested in situated activity systems. We argue that place is socially (re)constructed by youth where we come to understand the relations youth develop to a place, and the ways in which youth position themselves and are positioned socioculturally, politically, and geographically. To illustrate how this plays out, we draw on a `envisioning your future neighborhood' mapping activity, a community based program, `GET City', that is focused on green energy issues, and an instructional unit, `My Place in Puget Sound' to understand how youth make connections to place and are empowered to make decisions and changes in their local communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:20Z (GMT).

The design of this in-school and after-school program was motivated by concern over growing divides with respect to access to learning environments that can support empowered and generative uses of technology. Through a unique program that offered both a wide array of special interest after school clubs (e.g. robotics, graphic design, digital broadcast and movie making, music recording and remixing, video game development) and mandatory media arts classes during the school day, learners were able to develop broad and deep experiences across the middle school years. The program of research involved an ethnographic study focused on the learning environment, nine case studies of young producers and their learning ecologies across home, school, and community, and quantitative tracking of the entire cohort over time. In this session, four papers will be shared that describe 1) the environment; 2) the theoretical framework guiding the research, research questions, and associated methods; 3) the development of learners as creative producers; and 4) the role of artist-mentors as media arts instructors. The contributions of the symposium include sharing a unique interdisciplinary collaboration and the results of a unique experiment designed to bridge divides while innovating a new ecological model of learning. !","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:20Z (GMT).

It has been argued that disciplinary historical thinking, in particular, because of its emphasis on evaluating and reconciling conflicting accounts, translates into the skills required for informed citizenship. However, the research on historical thinking is marked by a pronounced absence of (1) prolonged curricular interventions in real classrooms and that attempt to develop students' historical thinking; (2) transfer studies that examine the application of students' historical thinking to digital resources and other texts with which students feel personally invested; (3) the use of multimodal texts in fostering students' historical thinking. The four papers presented in this symposium address these gaps by examining the development of students' historical thinking across instructional contexts with various textual resources.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:20Z (GMT).

The participating studies take advantage of computerized visualizations to bridge abstract science concepts and students' intuitive ideas of physical phenomena. These studies reveal how the visualizations help students improve their understanding of science over time by employing mixed methods such as data from student performances on pre-post tests and student practices during the learning process. These posters provide insights about how students learn from visualizations and propose effective design approaches to augment the impact of computerized visualizations. ! Introduction A major challenge that educators face is that student learning and understanding of subject areas often occurs at a superficial level (e.g., Krajcik &amp; Blumenfeld, 2006). Many teachers and researchers recognize the difficulty of promoting meaningful learning and deep understanding due to limited time, resources, tools and instructional strategies. However, with the rapid development of technology, research has emerged to provide promising evidence for how advanced technology tools can effectively transform teaching and learning practice to benefit student learning and promote deep understanding (e.g., Blumenfeld, Fishman, Krajcik, &amp; Marx, 2000; Goldstone &amp; Wilensky, 2008; Linn, Clark, &amp; Slotta, 2003; Wieman, Adams, &amp; Perkins, 2008). Specifically, this collection of studies examines the role of computerized visualizations in supporting students' understanding of physical sciences. Computerized visualizations such as simulations and dynamic models allow students access to unseen processes and abstract concepts in science. These external visualizations and models can help students form complex understandings of a given concept or phenomenon (Buckley, 2000). However, the process of student interacting with visualizations to form integrated understanding is not straightforward. Students' prior knowledge may influence their perception of phenomena and understanding of the external models (Rohr &amp; Reimann, 1998). Moreover, students need to integrate multiple types of knowledge and skills in order to make sense of the visualizations and successfully perform their learning tasks using the visualization. Students often need guidance to interact productively with visualizations. In this symposium, eight studies investigated how students developed coherent understanding of science using computerized visualizations with various types of support. This symposium will engage participants in discussing diverse viewpoints concerning the roles, effective strategies, and beneficial features of computerized visualizations to promote deep science learning. ! Purpose and Objectives We organize this interactive poster symposium to provide a platform for the presenters and the audience to discuss how computerized visualizations can promote strong conceptual connections between classroom science and the physical world. Research suggests that many natural science concepts (e.g., atomic interactions, acceleration, electricity) are abstract and challenging for students because they cannot meaningfully connect these concepts to real observations and concrete experiences. A wide range of computerized visualizations has been created to help students learn these difficult concepts. Many of these visualizations show effectiveness in improving students' science understanding. Through the collection of the studies we aim to answer the following questions surrounding the use of computerized visualizations in science classrooms: How can dynamic visualizations make science relevant to students' life? Students encounter everyday experience such as heat and temperature, electric circuits, and physical motions. The visualizations presented in the symposium aim to embed abstract disciplinary science knowledge (e.g., atomic models, Newtonian mechanics) in contexts that are familiar with students. How can visualizations help students distinguish spontaneous ideas gained from everyday experiences and scientific ideas learned in class? As students form intuitive ideas to explain observations they make about the world, visualizations can help students distinguish and link the spontaneous ideas from scientific ideas by","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:21Z (GMT).

Together, the authors ask a common question: How can learning technologies--tools, spaces, and places--be designed to support learners within and across environments? Eight exemplars are offered to answer this question through an analysis of a specific instance of technology in a non-school environment. Collectively, the authors examine the role of tools that support: access to and distribution of information; scaffolds to help learners tackle complex tasks and deeper understandings; bridging learning across contexts; feedback and reflection; extension of learning experiences in a temporal way; aggregations of visible knowledge, social interaction, facilitation of social practices, personalized learning, and the breakdown of epistemic authority. The authors and two discussants reflect on the methodological innovation, technological advancement, and collaborations needed to move research in this area forward.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:22Z (GMT).

The analysis of 20 learning groups (N = 59 teacher training students) revealed the following trends: High exchange orientation (i.e. being able to cooperate, compromise, resolve conflicts etc.) and high assertiveness within groups are associated with more satisfaction concerning collaboration quality and group performance. Heterogeneous groups with low group-means of the social skill exchange orientation were less satisfied with their work and stated to be less efficient in collaboration than other groups.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:25Z (GMT).

Pre and post testing and mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) longitudinal collection methods were used. The two studies focus on: (a) Gamestar Mechanic, an online video game, and (b) Quest to Learn, a games-based school which recently opened in New York City. Both studies assessed middle school students' ability to develop system-thinking skills as result of participating in these educational interventions. Levels of change in the development of systems thinking will be described in the paper, but the authors' main focus concerns how these gains were attained by the students. What role did context play in the learning process? The authors argue that a ""nodal ecology"" of redundant and predictable learning experiences serve to explain changes in cognitive development. ! This poster presentation presents two studies that assessed middle school participants' development of systems thinking after participating in games-based learning environments. Both learning environments were designed using a ""nodal ecologies framework,"" and claims about cognitive development have therefore been analyzed to understand the efficacy of this framework. Conceptualization of learning contexts as learning ecologies was guided by research and theories pointing to meaning making, cognitive development, and identity formation as a process whereby individuals travel through sets of varied but inter-related learning spaces (Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 1998; Goldman-Segall, 1998; Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991; White, 2008). The learning ecologies for both studies discussed in this paper have been framed around a set of interacting, interdependent learning nodes. Nodes in a particular ecology are defined as interconnected, but distinct physical or virtual spaces that house predictable and redundant instances of specialized content (e.g, systems-thinking, algebra, fashion, basketball), social activity, learning tools, and a discourse the defines certain ways of knowing and doing.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:35Z (GMT).

The poster describes how in two classrooms mathematical terminology provided a context for discussing graphs of linear functions, whereas everyday language used for the same mathematics resulted in ambiguous or unproductive discussion. As a component of an eight-day unit, students (n=50) were introduced to the word form slope to describe and compare linear functions. The case reported here presents a student before and after the introduction of the word slope.

Each poster presents recent empirical and/or theoretical findings that address how, when or why explaining is beneficial for learning. This session will highlight the similarities and differences among how the term explanation is used in cognitive science, psychology, and science education with the aim of moving the field towards a better understanding of how explanations can support learning. By bringing together these researchers we aim to encourage communication around what constitutes an explanation and how the researchers from different communities are addressing similar issues, such as the nature of teacher's explanations, student's explanations, expert's explanations, and self-explanations and their role in learning. Introduction Explaining a phenomenon or why it occurs is viewed as a central element of science. Similarly, learning from scientific explanations is seen as an important goal of science education (National Research Council, 2007). A multi-disciplinary line of research from the science education community, cognitive psychology community and learning sciences community is interested in understanding the role of explanations in learning. In this symposium we bring together these different perspectives to highlight current research surrounding how and why explanations benefit learning, and identify similarities and differences among these approaches as to what constitutes an explanation. Rationale There is a great deal of evidence that the process of generating explanations can be beneficial to learning (e.g. Chi et al. 1994), and there is some evidence that explaining can promote conceptual change in young children (Amsterlaw &amp; Wellman, 2006; Chi, 2000), but we do not know in detail how explaining helps learning (Lombrozo, 2006). Specifically we do not know what types of explanations are more or less beneficial for learning, what explanations look like in different disciplines, and what other factors might influence if and how explaining supports learning. This symposium has two main foci. First, we explore the relationship between the explanation and the type of learning being sought after, and second, we aim to identify variations within the term explanation. The researchers in this symposium address the role of explanations in learning in a variety of ways. For example, one poster investigates how teachers' pedagogical content knowledge of scientific explanation and argumentation changes while they learn new practices in professional development. Another poster investigates the relative impact of explanation, exploration and observation on children's learning of underlying causal relationships and mechanisms. Across these posters there are differences in the populations being studied and how researchers operationalize learning; however, the common focus on explanations in learning will enable productive communication between the researchers from different perspectives, and should support a fruitful discussion with audience members. Within the learning sciences community the term explanation is used in a variety of ways. The second goal of this symposium is to support a more precise understanding of the similarities and differences among these complementary perspectives. For example, one presenter views explanations as the ""big ideas"" or conceptual frameworks that are socially accepted by the professional science community, and aims to help students develop these kinds of complex understandings. Other posters view constructing explanations as a critical practice within the scientific community and present research that explores how both students and teachers develop epistemic understanding of scientific explanations. A poster from the cognitive science perspective builds upon the philosophy of science to view explaining as a constraint on learning that facilitates the interpretation of observations in terms of unifying patterns. One poster puts forth a comprehensive taxonomy of the possible components of a scientific explanation that can be used to characterize and better understand various types of novice and expert explanations (for a complete summary of posters, see Table 1). By bringing these perspectives together, we aim to encourage greater communication across fields and further our collective understanding of the nature and utility of explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:59Z (GMT).

We draw upon a variety of empirical data to explore the way the Learning Sciences is a distributed phenomenon, built on assemblages of artifacts, in which cognition is distributed and constructed, and identities are constituted. Our analysis has three steps. First, we explore the learning sciences community as a space in which discourse circulates, concepts are put forward, and specific kinds of objects have become recognized. Central among these objects, of course, is 'learning.' Second, we look in detail at examples of the interactions in which learning scientists do their work. Third, we consider how a learning scientist is formed as a particular kind of person through participation in formative practices of the community.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:13:59Z (GMT).

We examine how the development of identity relative to a particular domain-specific learning environment--such as a leadership seminar, a nature trail guide program, a writing class project, or a teacher professional development course--can be better understood by looking at learners as whole persons, relative to their other experiences and identities. In other words, we investigate evolving identity within contexts by looking more broadly at participant identity across contexts. The session will present findings from this research, share methods for accomplishing this difficult work and making it manageable, discuss implications for further theory-building about identity, and provide recommendations for designing learning environments with identity development in mind.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:14:00Z (GMT).

These four units (one focused on mathematics, science, language arts, and social studies) are situated in an online, multiplayer videogame called Quest Atlantis, supporting over 25,000 children worldwide. Each presented unit has gone through multiple iterations of implementation, analysis, and redesign, informed by empirical data and our evolving theoretical framework. In reviewing both results from comparison studies and differences in international engagement with the units, our accounts will illuminate the theory transformational play, how the theory has shaped design and interpretations of findings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T14:14:02Z (GMT).
