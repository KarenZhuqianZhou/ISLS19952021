The participants were working by turns on a common presentation that should outline their opinions on the topic. During this alternating process they had to think aloud to make individual processes observable. In addition, we analyzed the development of the shared text. We combined a content analysis and the think-aloud data to measure internal and external processes of knowledge construction, and we describe how these processes influenced each other. This procedure led to insights into the development of perception shared by the participants and into the resulting knowledge construction with respect to quantitative and qualitative processes. In particular, we analyzed the interplay between the participants' thinking and writing processes as well as the co-evolution of their thinking and writing as cognitive and social processes. In our conclusion we discuss the implications of our findings for understanding processes of knowledge construction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

One reason for this disengagement is that learners are often not given the chance to choose how to pursue their personal goals using science reasoning. Therefore, we are creating science programs that emphasize life-relevant learning - the ability to engage science learners in the context of achieving their own goals. We developed Kitchen Chemistry to engage and support children in the design of their own personal investigations. In this paper, we use a case study analysis to examine three groups of learners in Kitchen Chemistry. We analyze the decisions that learners make, how learners make these decisions, and the supports needed to make informed choices. We examine how the use of semi-structured activities, whole group discussions, adult facilitation, and mobile technologies interact and support learners in their decision-making practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:32Z (GMT).

The goal of this research was to examine the extent to which young students can make promisingness judgments and, as a result, engage in more effective knowledge building. Toward this end we embedded a design experiment in a Grade 3 classroom. In this experiment students were engaged in discussion and reflection of the concept of promisingness and used a Promising Ideas tool to identify promising ideas in their written online discourse. They used the tool for two refinements of idea selections to focus ongoing community dialogue. Results suggest that students as young as 8 years of age can make promisingness judgments that facilitate knowledge advancement in their work. These results inform future work in classroom interventions and tool development to promote promisingness judgments in collaborative knowledge building.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:33Z (GMT).

It uses positioning analysis to examine the relationship between moments of identity enactment in social learning communities and temporally longer trajectories of identification. It does so by examining the trajectory of identification (and by extension the arc of participation) of an eight year-old CivWorld participant named Salim as he moves from peripheral towards more full participation in the community, moving from a novice in history and game-play toward becoming an expert over a six month period.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:34Z (GMT).

Teenagers are an important category of future energy consumers, but little is known about their conceptions. We report on research to design learning technologies that support teenagers' learning about personal consumption of energy. In this paper we describe our analysis and methodology, which are shaped by the Ecology of Resources design framework (Luckin, 2010). Findings suggest teenagers are aware of energy issues at an abstract level, but do not apply this information in the context of their behaviour. We identify indirect energy use and the relative energy intensity of different behaviours as important areas for learning. For example, behaviours of particular relevance to teenagers are use of electronic devices, and choice of food and personal care products. These findings have implications for the design of technology to support learning about energy in informal contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In particular, we study whether affect is a mediating variable between learner attributes and engagement/disengagement during learning. To this end, we conduct exploratory path analysis on data from middle school learners who were conducting inquiry in science a microworld. We find weak but significant relationships between variables related to attitudes and beliefs and variables related to affective states and engagement.

From this perspective, we propose the two concepts of student's twofold semiosis and teacher's equilibration work, which allow us to understand the instructional practice and the learning process in the same conceptualization. We illustrate these concepts and our video research methodology within two case studies. The first case study concerns tactile reading with a visually impaired student at primary school. The second case study refers to a learning situation proposed by Brousseau (2004), the Treasure Game, which one can see as a fundamental situation for the representational process. By contrasting the two cases, we attempt to identify two different kinds of equilibration works. We show how these two different equilibration works involve different ways of articulating the twofold semiosis in the didactic transactions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:36Z (GMT).

In our work with the LilyPad Arduino, an e-textile construction kit with controller, sensors and actuators that can be embedded via conductive thread and programmed in fabric and garments, we examine how functional aesthetics can play a productive or sometimes unproductive role in learning. Drawing from observations and interviews with 35 high school youth that created e-textile artifacts, we identified three different approaches ranging from giving up on desired designs to making something functional or not finishing or getting a design to work because of unwillingness to give up on aesthetics. We see the third approach, finding a new design that both meets aesthetic desires and matches affordances of the technologies, as particularly promising approach and discuss how aesthetic dimensions can provide important connections in learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:37Z (GMT).

They trace the development of student ideas as they grow in sophistication, across levels that are reasonably coherent networks of ideas and practices. This paper examines whether and how published LPs and LTs address issues of equity. It presents a case study where a curriculum guided by an LP closed or reduced gaps between mainstream and minority groups. We argue that implicit in most LP/LT work is a definition of equity as equal treatment for all students, and propose an alternate definition involving responsive instruction and materials that contemplate individual differences. From the analytic literature review and case study, we abstract guidelines for the development of LPs and LTs, and curriculum materials based on these, to make them more responsive to students and thus more equitable.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:37Z (GMT).

This paper reports on a study of a teacher's pedagogical journey over three years, from the time when she was a novice teacher making the first attempt in introducing KB in her classroom to becoming fluent and confident in designing and executing curriculum units that will be successful in advancing students' understanding through their engagement in synchronous discourse on KF. The findings reveal a shift in the teacher's design focus, followed by a refinement in facilitation skills.

Deep learning, in turn, is related to higher degrees of transfer and self-efficacy. It follows that population correlation estimates of the relationship between self-efficacy and training transfer should be higher in those conditions that afford computer support and collaboration. This meta-analysis (29 studies, k = 33, N = 4,158) tested this assumption. Based on social cognitive theory, results suggested positive population correlation estimates between self-efficacy and transfer (U = 0.39). Results also showed that effect sizes were higher in trainings with rather than without computer support, and higher in trainings without rather than with collaboration. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for theories of complex social and computer-mediated learning environments and their practical significance for scaffolding technology-enhanced learning and interaction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:38Z (GMT).

The students are required to form groups to assemble eligible Chinese characters using the components that the group members possess. Fifteen Primary 3 (3rd grade) students were involved in the study. The game process data and the transcriptions of focus group interviews were qualitatively analyzed in order to investigate the dynamics of student collaboration and competition during the games. The study aims to explore the patterns of social interactions during the activities, especially the varied impacts of the two different grouping rules (allowing versus not allowing each student to join more than one group at one time) on the students' game behaviors and their learning gains.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:38Z (GMT).

By examining how young children represent the images of learning through their drawings, we have distilled the types of learning tools that are being accentuated from students' emic perspective. We contend that the prevalence, absence or peripheral representation of tools (in particular technology) in students' drawings will help us make sense of the collective cultural roles tools play in their world. Interviews are also conducted with students and teachers to further tease out the underpinnings of children's conception of learning. The content analysis of 183 drawings revealed that technological tools were more prominently featured in mix-achievement classes than high-achievement classes. The reasons for such discrepancy emanate from the distinct learning priorities of and strategies used by these two groups of students. We also extend our discussion to explore the pedagogical implications of our findings with regard to 21st century learning dispositions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:39Z (GMT).

Building from the core characteristic of ARGs as collaborative sense-making systems, we sought to integrate elements of effective cooperative learning environments, such as positive interdependence, into our game design. We detail how cooperative learning constructs were designed into the narrative and game mechanics, and how evidence of these features emerged during play. We found that the jigsaw puzzle design of game challenges supported collaboration between groups; daily, whole-class discussions strengthened group processing; and real-time, chat-based dialogue among students themselves and students with an in-game character enhanced promotive interaction (e.g., providing positive reinforcement). However, we did note weaknesses in positive interdependence within groups. We conclude with design implications for future iterations of the ARG.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:39Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this study, two school leaders formed a dyad to learn both the knowledge about innovation diffusion and the knowledge in fostering innovation diffusion. Agent-based model building, model simulation, game play of a simulation game and reflections were designed as learning activities in this study. In the learning process, the learners developed the following understanding in innovation diffusion: teachers' adoption decisions are based on limited rationality and local information; teachers have nonlinear influence on each other through social networks; teachers are heterogonous agents; and diffusion is a process of emergence. The learners also learnt to leverage on social networks to foster effective innovation diffusion. While agent-based model building faces challenges for learning CAS in the social science domain, this study shows that engaging learners in reflection activities helps to overcome the challenges.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:40Z (GMT).

Along with the analysis of the main design activities of the process, we created CORDTRA diagrams for analyzing the interaction and the use of tools. The results indicate that the lamp designing process was a successful learning process. Through repeated cycles of designing, and by simulating many professional design practices, the young students were able to collaboratively develop a design, where various constraints determining lamp and light designing were taken into account.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:40Z (GMT).

We characterize and evaluate this prospective synergy from a sociocultural perspective. First we analyze learning in explicitly embodied cultural practices (e.g., surfing), then analogize to the implicitly embodied practice of mathematics. We next contextualize this analogy via interpreting data collected in a design-based research study, in which twenty-two 9-to-11-year-olds developed notions of proportionality through participating in guided problem-solving activities in an embodied-interaction space. In both surfing and mathematics, we argue, learners develop ""embodied artifacts,"" i.e. body-based and modular rehearsed actions. Embodied artifacts lend individuals entry into disciplinary competence via participation in action, refinement of operations, and integration into activity structures. Furthermore, embodied artifacts may become ""conceptual performances,"" wherein performance not merely augments, but stands for and constitutes understanding.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:40Z (GMT).

An assessment of such maps can help to detect misconceptions and can serve as a basis for learner feedback. If used as a basis for agent-based scaffolding, the assessment needs to be calculated automatically by the system at run-time. Previous approaches have used an expert concept map as a reference for calculating such quality measures. This paper describes an approach that works without an explicit expert concept map but only uses more general domain ontology. To determine and adjust an automated quality measure student concept maps were collected and analysed by experts. The expert judgment was compared to certain structural measures based on graph-theoretical concepts and to enriched measures that additionally included ontology relations. It turned out that the inherent characteristic of concept maps as scale-free networks rules out certain structural measures as positive quality indicators.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:41Z (GMT).

However, it is unclear what interdisciplinary thinking means and how to assess students' interdisciplinary understanding. In this paper, drawing from multiple perspectives in the learning sciences, we aim to apply and refine a theoretical framework that helps define interdisciplinary learning in science. Specifically, we examine four cognitive dimensions of interdisciplinary understanding: integration, translation, transfer, and transformation (IT3 framework). We apply the framework in analyzing the conversations among university faculty members from different science disciplines who strive to improve college level science education. We report our results and further discuss the implications of using our framework in conceptualizing interdisciplinary learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:41Z (GMT).

By contrast, a clear pattern of steps in the problem solving process of the Innovation dyads showed that most students could perceive and verbalize the correct solution to the practice problems (7 of 9 dyads) but had trouble translating their insights into a mathematical solution. Only three Innovation dyads successfully translated their perceptions into correct mathematical formulations--suggesting an area for further scaffolding in future work. However, five of these six individuals correctly solved the difficult posttest transfer problem.

The unit incorporates the Idea Manager, a new inquiry scaffolding technology that helps students record their ideas and construct coherent explanations. We scored the conceptual content of the ideas students recorded, how students organized their ideas, and the coherence of students' explanations. Regression models show that students' ability to distinguish ideas predicted explanation coherence more strongly than the number of relevant ideas they recorded. Three cases illustrate difficulties some students had using molecular concepts to support their explanations.

The overall purpose of the study is to identify general principles for how to design learning environments that prepare learners to be creative. First, I document the cultural model of teaching and learning held by the faculty and students, and analyze the pedagogical practices used. This studio model is of interest because it emerged naturally in a community of educational practice. I argue that it is distinct from the two cultural models most familiar to learning scientists: instructionism and apprenticeship. Second, I argue that the studio model is more closely aligned with learning sciences principles than either instructionism or apprenticeship. Third, I draw lessons from this studio model for designing learning environments in all school subjects, in particular STEM subjects.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:42Z (GMT).

In an experimental 2x2 design (N = 119), we investigated whether both components can be fostered through heuristic worked examples and collaboration scripts which were implemented in a CSCL environment. Results indicate that the individual-cognitive component was facilitated by the provision of heuristic worked-out examples, whereas the social-discursive component was fostered through the use of collaboration scripts and of heuristic worked examples. Both scaffolds were especially helpful for learners with higher general ability. It appears that scaffolds on a content level as well as scaffolds on a social level are necessary to help learners attain high levels of mathematical argumentation skills.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:42Z (GMT).

Empirical CSCL studies published between 2005- 2008 were selected from seven leading journals of the field and analyzed in terms of their technology supports. nalyses showed that communication technologies were most popular with asynchronous collaboration being the dominant mode of interaction. lthough CSCL was predominantly supported by communication tools, diverse types of additional technologies (e.g., representational tool, simulations) were used to support both face-to-face and distributed collaboration. Technology supports varied depending on the educational levels, domains, and pedagogical approaches of the learning environments. Based on these analyses, we discuss five distinct ways that technology can support collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Dominant frameworks are inspired either by Piagetian or information processing perspectives on cognition, and all have failed to explain a range of empirical results that question the stability and coherence predicted by these frameworks. Recent models from a more situated perspective seem much more capable of explaining the variability seen empirically. This paper adds to this situated perspective by outlining a research approach for ""locating"" epistemic beliefs within analyses that triangulate between people's participation in knowledge construction and evaluation, the artifacts such participation may produce, and individual's reflection upon both participation and artifacts. Examples of such work are used to demonstrate the fruitfulness of this approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The study investigated whether collaboration scripts help improving students revision activities and the quality of wiki-texts. We compared scripted (script ) with unscripted (script-) collaboration in a wiki-based writing setting that was adapted for educational purposes. Students from two university courses participated in a one week collaborative writing activity. Results showed that students in the scripted condition outperformed students in the unscripted condition with respect to revision behavior and text-quality. Results from analyzing students' discussions during the writing activity revealed increased coordination concerning task division and increased communication frequency for students in the scripted condition. Results indicate that collaboration scripts may trigger coordination.

High school students studied the Web-based Inquiry Science Environment unit, Global Climate Change in one of three conditions. We compare student learning outcomes. We find that traditional spacing resulted in larger gains, in apparent contrast to the findings of many studies of distributing practice. We further investigate this finding to understand how spacing might have impacted revisiting and restudying of earlier work. Specifically, we use log files to determine how students revisited earlier work, finding that condition moderated the effect of revisiting on outcomes. Students in the distributed condition tended to revisit proximal steps, whereas those in the clustered condition tended to revisit steps while writing explanations at the end of the unit. We discuss implications and directions for further study.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:44Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Typical questions implied by this stance include: How do we help students develop more accurate or fruitful knowledge structures? How do we overcome misconceptions in science or mathematics? How do we train skills more efficiently, employing what we know of human memory and learning? How do we encourage the growth of metacognitive skills? While such questions are interesting, this paper argues that they are ultimately peripheral for the purposes of designing effective educational technology. Indeed, the ""cognitive science stance"" tends to ignore or take for granted issues that are, in fact, much more central and productive in guiding design. These are questions rooted in anthropology, not cognitive science. They include: How and why do children make friends? What features of physical settings encourage (or discourage) the development of children's interest? Why, and in what situations, do children develop intense intellectual passions and obsessions? This paper discusses the sorts of questions that designers of educational technology need to ask in order to make progress beyond the confines of cognitive science research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:44Z (GMT).

I embark from the conjecture that these shortcomings result from cognitive discontinuity between intuitive forms of sense-making that deal with objects and actions and algebraic formulas traditionally used in this discipline. I propose and that a new form of representation, agent-based models, may offer greater cognitive continuity from sense-making to disciplinary knowledge. Study 1, an analysis of textbook content and lecturer practice, confirmed the cognitive-discontinuity conjecture by implicating the epistemic challenges of converting sense-making into formulas. Study 2 was a longitudinal evaluation of an agent-based, complementary curricular unit for materials science undergraduates. A micro-ethnographic case study of one student's progress through this unit documents the challenges and achievements of appropriating the agent based perspective as means of empowering sense-making.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:44Z (GMT).

We do so by offering a micro- genetic analysis of a relatively surprising case of transfer by a student in a high school biology class. In particular, we use her case to evaluate five recently proposed explanations for exactly how expansive framing may foster transfer, and close with additional hypotheses for how transfer may have been supported with this particular student.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:46Z (GMT).

Consequential feedback describes a form of feedback that is embedded in the context with which a student is engaging, and allows the student to see how their solution to a problem plays out in that context. Comparing two classes across two years, we considered how the timing of feedback impacted student engagement. Findings suggest that providing consequential feedback in the form of a narrative outcome supported students to offer more mathematical justification, consequential justification, and to engage critically with the mathematical content within their written recommendations. The impact of consequential feedback appears to be potentially heightened by total time in class discussion, presence of more frequent discussions, and increased immersion in the narrative.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:46Z (GMT).

Coding considered several dimensions: relations (macro/micro, biotic/abiotic, structure- behavior-function) as well as coherence, and extraneous structures. Findings suggest that students may follow multiple non-linear trajectories towards an increasingly coherent understanding of ecosystems. Even so, the ability to observe phenomena at multiple macro/micro and biotic/abiotic levels may be an underlying constraint to also observing integrated structure-behavior-function relations and the development of a more coherent understanding of ecosystems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:47Z (GMT).

Because representations are the only external input that learners use to make sense of imperceptible phenomena, the design of the representations becomes critical. However, studies imply that commonly used conventional visual representations tend to direct learners to overestimate imperceptible sizes and underestimate the difference between them. Hence, the need for a novel representation that can provide the way learners an alternative experience with the imperceptible sizes emerges. To address this issue, we designed a multimodal representation that incorporates temporal sense to transmit imperceptible sizes. In this paper, we introduce our recent research that explored the different effects of the compressed and extended form of temporal experience on student learning of the range of imperceptible sizes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:47Z (GMT).

Topic modeling, an emerging field in machine learning, has the potential to solve this problem by automatically extracting from text collections formal representations of latent topics. However, the interpretation of latent topics is still a challenge, which hinders the use of this state-of-the-art technology from wider use in CSCL contexts. In a recent paper, we put forward a novel topic discovery method, the fLDA model, based on Minsky's Frame theory. This method has the advantage of providing outputs that are potentially more easily interpretable for generating the topic of each thematic cluster. In this paper, we show how fLDA can be used in extracting and visualizing the topics of asynchronous online discourse from four classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:49Z (GMT).

This paper proposes that the effort of a teacher, Nicole, helped learners find their inner persuasive voices and developed their conceptual agency in learning Geography. The transition of Nicole's Geography class is examined by comparing episodes from different periods of the project implementation, with the goal of finding out how students' agency emerges from this transition.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:49Z (GMT).

In this paper we modeled decision-making, and used time to identify four patterns of tool use to make decisions: single chat, multiple chat, chat/s and follow-up wiki, and integrated. Each pattern of tool use was associated with a unique process model, which indicated the affordances of each tool for that particular activity.

In the first study, students were either provided or not provided with monohybrid inheritance pre-requisites for their complex problem-solving activity. The second study compared a teacher-led with a student-led comparison and contrast during the consolidation phase. Findings of the first study suggested that students may not have adequate priors to generate representations and solution methods that explore multi-level conceptions. Findings of the second study suggested that teacher involvement in the compare-and-contrast may be beneficial for better knowledge assembly.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:49Z (GMT).

In a series of web-based self-monitoring protocols, participants (N=49) recorded their class preparation. In the experimental condition, they received individual scores of dilatory behavior mirrored in a line chart. We were interested in whether potential advantages of the line chart can be traced back to non-specific signaling of dilatory behavior or to specific individual feedback. Therefore, we compared the experimental group with two control groups: without visualization or with random visualization. The random visualization was expected to have a signaling but no feedback effect. Results supported the effects of signaling and individual feedback. Participants with random or veridical visualizations were more likely to engage in self-reflection, but only those who received individual feedback were more likely to reduce their dilatory behavior and improved self- regulated learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:50Z (GMT).

When designing problem sequences with multiple representations, designers of intelligent tutoring systems must decide how to schedule the representations. Prior research on contextual interference has demonstrated that interleaving different types of learning tasks can foster a deep understanding of the underlying concepts. Do the same advantages apply to interleaving representations? In a classroom experiment, we compared four conditions that varied the practice schedules of multiple graphical representations between interleaving and blocking. The multiple-representation conditions were compared to three single-representation control conditions. During their regular classroom instruction, 290 4th and 5th-grade students worked for five hours with versions of an intelligent tutoring system for fractions. On several dependent measures, interleaving multiple graphical representations led to better learning results than blocking multiple graphical representations. Findings from a think-aloud study give insight into the underlying cognitive processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this paper, we propose that learning progressions research offers a methodical approach to organize the learning pathways students take to improve conceptual competence in complex systems. As a first step, we articulate a sequence of complex systems ideas - from the least to most difficult - by analyzing students' written responses. Using an Item Response Theory model, we found that the easiest ideas to grasp are those that relate to the interconnected nature of these systems whereas the most difficult ideas are those concerning the decentralized organization of the system, and the predictability of the system effects.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:51Z (GMT).

Here, we present results of a experimental study of Algebra I students (N = 145) receiving context personalization within an intelligent tutoring system, Cognitive Tutor Algebra. Results suggest that personalization allowed students to form more accurate and meaningful situation models of story problems, facilitating algebraic symbolization. Interest-based interventions may allow learners to make critical connections between personally relevant scenarios and abstract representational systems. Adaptive learning environments that personalize instruction by leveraging interests are an important future direction for advanced learning technologies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:51Z (GMT).

On the other hand, researchers have highlighted empirical evidence showing that `pure' discovery- based learning is of limited value. This suggests that how learners interact is important in predicting whether learning occurs. This paper reports on a study of 158 university students who each used two instructional simulations one with a discovery-based design and the other with a tutorial-based design. Students' learning outcomes were assessed via pre-tests and post-tests of conceptual understanding. Students' interactions using the discovery-based program were recorded and coded as either systematic or unsystematic. The results showed that when compared with the tutorial-based learning program systematic exploration resulted in learning benefits, while unsystematic exploration did not. These results have implications for the design of instructional software if such resources are to be used effectively.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:51Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In order to properly deal with the ""wicked problems"" arising from this interaction, learners must recognize that there is ""no right answer"", since solutions require compromise. They must also use spatial concepts instrumentally to reason about these systems. We propose to address these challenges by adapting authentic complex human-natural systems models into collaborative learning experiences. To do so, we need to better understand the challenges learners face as they use simulations to link spatial reasoning with dynamic processes. This paper presents two cases where we examine learners' spatial and problem-solving strategies as they interact with a modified stormwater management model. We show that learners require support for core spatial reasoning skills and for problem solving around wicked problems. We then recommend forms of scaffolding and further development.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In part, this is because (design) research is often conducted at the bleeding edge of what is possible, exploring innovative uses of new technologies and/or emerging theories, while insufficient research and development work focuses on what is practical, today. This leaves a problematic gap between what could be useful research in theory, and what can be useful research in practice. This paper calls for (design) researchers to attend to factors that determine if and how innovations are understood, adopted and used by teachers and schools, and gives one example of how this was tackled in the domain of early literacy. Across ten studies, researchers collected data that helped shape an intervention that can be implemented by representative teachers, for diverse learners, in varied school settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:02:52Z (GMT).

A number of groups have been working to create and evaluate next-generation assessments that both evaluate students on 21st Century scientific skills and provide evidence models for making inferences about student proficiency. In this symposium, researchers who are currently developing and testing simulation-based and immersive assessments to meaningfully assess science content and inquiry skills will share findings from classroom-based studies of students using the assessments.

Identity is a particularly useful concept for highlighting extraordinary individual experiences, interpreting rich social contexts, and viewing learning at multiple timescales, from an instant reaction to lifelong psychosocial development. However, identity is complex--it is conceptualized differently by various academic traditions. This inherent diversity can lead to a confusing or murky notion of identity. In this symposium, we clarify the concept, integrating the relevant theoretical perspectives of social and psychological identity to assess its implications to design, research, and practice. We provide concrete examples from our own research of the benefits of viewing learning as identity formation and the challenges to conducting such research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:43Z (GMT).

Specifically, we aim to study aspects of the platform that allow us to investigate learning related to: (a) the integration of game mechanics into the design of instructional materials, (b) youths' engagement in contemporary scientific practices, and (c) platform features that make youths' interests, expertise, and experiences visible so that they can be leveraged in instruction. We explore how to promote generative conditions for expertise development within these technology-mediated social learning networks and the effects of those experiences on student participation, identification, and learning of knowledge, skills, and practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:44Z (GMT).

We contend that argumentation can be used productively in learning mathematics even at the primary level. A research study was designed to explore children's development of argumentation in an Australian primary mathematics classroom. The classroom of 23 children (aged 9-10) had regularly used an inquiry-based approach to address extended, complex, ill-structured problems. The children's discussions and use of evidence is reported as they considered contentious media claims. The results of the design-based research study suggest that the children became proficient with Toulmin's argument framework (simplified). They were able to use this framework to plan, implement and defend the outcomes of a mathematical investigation they designed to provide evidence for or against the media claims. The paper highlights benefits and challenges with which student grappled while making and substantiating their final claims.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:44Z (GMT).

Starting from the construction of a network of explicit and implicit relations between ideas, we apply a scientometric method to tackle the temporality of collaborative processes based on the structure of successive ideas. The resulting discourse trajectories are shown to give a holistic and also a detailed view on how knowledge advances when their interpretation is combined with a qualitative analysis of the content of the ideas and their relations. The weighted relevance of relations between ideas enables the identification of sub-topics in the discourse, important ideas, and influence or uptake events.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:45Z (GMT).

A central goal was to identify challenges to achieving emic or self-organized structure necessary for sustaining innovative educational programs. The study found that a local social and emotional dynamic influenced the emergence of a strong global dynamic of social support that ultimately produced the contextual outcome of low productivity. The paper asserts that teachers need intentional training to gain skills for working autonomously. Helping teachers become aware of the dynamics needed for successful collaboration would assist in achieving self-organized participation. An important contribution of this study is the application of a dynamic systems lens, which enabled the location of levels of micro and macroscopic influences that can be used to inform future professional development activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:45Z (GMT).

During the iterative cycles of inquiry learning, learners' prior domain knowledge is modified, refined, and further developed, provided that learners act upon self-assessments of their understanding and that they can actually think of appropriate hypotheses. Furthermore, knowledge about inquiry strategies influences the quality of the learners' inquiry activities, and the lack thereof requires compensatory support. This symposium brings together recent work about the role of prior knowledge for inquiry learning and ways to compensate for the lack of it. The four papers focus on the role of learners' self-assessment of their current understanding for their subsequent inquiry activities, on the gradual refinement of their knowledge on the basis of reflection, and on prior presentation of theoretical background information and concurrent presentation of inquiry strategies as ways to compensate for lack of prior theoretical knowledge and strategy knowledge, respectively.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:46Z (GMT).

The 55-item instrument contained three scales (absolutism, multiplism, evaluativism), that reflected different stages in epistemic development (Kuhn, 1991; 1999), moving from nave to sophisticated beliefs. Rasch analysis was used to analyze the data. The analysis confirmed the existence of the three scales with moderate reliability coefficients.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:47Z (GMT).

Our investigation of establishment involves a close look at the co-constitution of practice with communal knowledge. To do so, we employ a theoretical framework that characterizes forms of participation in defining, and illustrates how these aspects contributed to developing a mathematical system of definitions. The teacher, taking the role of a disciplinary representative, supported this co-establishment by modeling aspects of definitional practice, by positioning students as participants in practice, and by positioning definitions at the forefront of discussion. As students began to appropriate definitional practices, they, in turn, became supporters of their collective enterprise of defining. These characterizations of definitional practices and supports may provide resources for developing similar classroom environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:48Z (GMT).

In this paper, we describe the theoretical underpinnings that guided the design of WiMVT framework, the components and core features as well as the work flow of WiMVT. We elucidate our development process that supports the development of the system. To examine the functional usability and evaluate its impact on students' learning, a pilot study was conducted to show the findings with implications for how to improve the functionalities of the existing, briefly present the learning outcomes of lessons with the system, and provide feedback to the researchers, designers and teachers. Keywords: WiMVT; science learning; inquiry Background Learning science through inquiry that incorporates Information and Communication Technologies and scientific practices has been a desired pedagogical approach for science learning. In recent years, a number of computer- supported inquiry-based science learning environments have been developed, studied and evaluated, such as WISE, Co-Lab, Inquiry Island, and nQuire. Substantial evidence reported such learning environments could facilitate the development of cognitive and metacognitive strategies in the pupils (Schwarz &amp; White, 2005). Due to benefits for learners and the educational demand for a new science learning environment to effectively support the class and meeting the societal demands on science education, a group of researchers at Learning Sciences Laboratory, National Institute of Education in Singapore endeavours to develop a web-based science learning environment named WiMVT system (Web-based inquirer with Modelling and Visualization Technology, http://www.sstlsl-wimvt.sg/wimvt/). It is designed as an innovative learning environment in which modelling and visualization, inquiry and social interaction brought together and integrated. With a number of features, the system is targeted to support secondary school students to acquire sophisticated understanding of scientific conceptions, develop crucial learning skills (inquiry skills, modelling skills, collaborative learning skills) and reasoning skills, as well as reflective thinking skills. We will present a pilot study of WiMVT system, which happened at the stage of the development of simplified version. It is hoped this study could contribute to narrowing the gap between the design and development of a science learning environment and its actual usage and enactment in the classroom practice. Theoretical Underpinnings The pedagogical principles in model-based inquiry serve as the guide for design decisions on the framework of the WiMVT system. Different teaching patterns were formed and demonstrated in relevant studies. White and Frederiksen (2002) proposed an inquiry cycle that consisted of ""question-predict-experiment-mode-apply"". The results indicated that both of lower and higher achieving students benefit from this inquiry model. The inquiry phases in the Inquiry Island were described with questions, hypothesis, plan, investigation, creation and evaluation of models, and the evaluation of models and research processes. It was proposed to facilitate students' sociocognitive and metacognitive development (White, et al., 2002). Christina and Gwekwerer (2007) designed an inquiry framework EIMA: Engage-Investigate-Model-Apply. This inquiry pattern encouraged students' engaging in the guided inquiry with a focus on creating, using and revising models. In summary, despite of using different teaching patterns, these studies pointed to the necessity of having modelling as an important component in science inquiry. And the model-based inquiry process could mainly include orientation or question, hypothesis, plan, investigation, model, and conclusion (Bell, et al., 2010). With modelling as one of major strategies to visualize and examine students' conceptual understanding in science class, and guided by the relevant design and the educational principle: Predict-Observe-Explain (POE) adopted in science class in some Singapore schools (White &amp; Gunstone, 1992), as it has been demonstrated as an effective way to examine students' prior knowledge and conceptual changes. Thus, we propose a phase named Pre-model with corresponding Model in the inquiry cycle to probe students' conceptual transformation process. Finally, based on the theoretical analysis discussed above, considering other prominent learning environments' design, a revised model-based inquiry cycle proceeded with eight phases is proposed: Contextualize, Question &amp; Hypothesize (Q&amp;H), Pre-model, Plan, Investigate, Model, Reflect, and Apply. These eight phases are refined as the components of the WiMVT inquiry cycle. Icons were used to denote each phase of the inquiry cycle in the system.

Specifically, students were tasked with producing autobiographical radio documentaries in the style of This American Life. We used the development of metarepresentational competence (MRC) as our measure for how effectively students engaged with identity in their production process. We found three types of MRC trajectories: Students who demonstrated MRC throughout the process, students who demonstrated MRC late in the process, and students who never demonstrated MRC. Students who demonstrated MRC created pieces that took advantage of the affordances of radio as a mode for self-representation as they communicated their personal stories and reflected on the relationship between tools and ideas in sophisticated ways. Our findings can inform the design of learning environments within fields of artistic production as well as other content areas emphasizing the importance of ""identity work"" in learning, a focus in recent design-based learning sciences research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:48Z (GMT).

Analysing the final product of group work does not reveal individual contributions or the collaborative process. This research investigates indicators of collaborative learning, captured by a novel tabletop environment, which can provide real-time information about the ongoing collaborative work. This can enable teachers to direct their attention more effectively. This paper reports findings from a case study on collaborative concept mapping. Five triads of university students engaged in a collaborative activity on the topic of human nutrition. The variables, level of participation, symmetry of participation, similarity of previous knowledge, knowledge contribution, transactivity, interaction and knowledge creation, were used to describe the collaborative process. Results offer promise for transforming this collaboration data to give informative feedback to teachers and support collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:50Z (GMT).

Yet, the learning environments we develop require high levels of motivation. In this conceptual paper, we provide evidence that motivation is marginalized, explain why that might be the case, and provide a way forward that may help ensure our designs better instantiate what we know about motivation in practice. Design-based research (DBR) offers the possibility of connecting motivation research to practice in ways that have not occurred in other disciplines, such as educational psychology. A clearer focus on applying and translating motivation research in design settings will inform our own designs and test motivation theory in ways that are necessary to make motivation more relevant for practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:50Z (GMT).

We tested this feedback approach on 43 8th-grade students, and our findings illustrate that: (1) stu- dents conversational choices provide valuable insight into their current mental state, (2) de- spite the help, some students struggled to learn using the system.

However, Productive Failure has usually been compared to Direct Instruction in studies with several confounds. These evaluations, therefore, do not allow conclusions regarding the underlying learning mechanisms. To address this criticism, we compared four conditions in a quasi-experimental study with 154 10th graders: We varied the form of instruction in two Direct Instruction conditions (a regular DI condition and a DI-S condition where instruction built on typical student-generated representations) and the type of support students received in two Productive Failure conditions (a regular PF condition and a PF+ condition with additional cognitive support). Our results indicate that students benefit from introducing new concepts based on student-generated representations. Moreover, during generation motivational support seems sufficient, that is, students do not need cognitive support.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Our results give evidence for a multimodal view of language production that is closely tied to context. We show how some gestures remain stable across explanatory tasks, irrespective of interactional situations but how other gestures remain stable across interactional situations. We suggest implications for teaching-learning situations regarding gestured explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A total of sixty-two nine- to eleven-year-old students participated in two studies that tested the hypothesis that monitoring the reasoning of a pedagogical agent solving math problems, can help students learn the skill of monitoring, and eventually self- correct when solving math problems. A projective pedagogical agent ""ProJo"" was designed to openly displays its reasoning when solving math problems allowing children to ""look for mistakes"". Two testing environments ""Doodle Math"", and ""Puzzle Math"" were implemented to directly compare self-monitoring and self-other monitoring treatment. The results showed initial evidence that self-other monitoring may be an effective way to help students develop metacognitive skills to self-correct and accurately solve problems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:52Z (GMT).

This paper builds on the Differential Influence framework developed by Engle, Langer-Osuna and McKinney de Royston to consider the powerful role of artifacts in group work. Specially, we argue that if a student has greater influence over a shared artifact developed by the group, then they may have greater Perceived Authority as well as Access to the Conversational Floor and Interactional Space. They may also be able to influence the group's collaborative decisions despite challenges to the Perceived Merit of their ideas. Based on the impact of the shared learning artifact on these interdependent dimensions, we discuss how a student's power and influence is perpetuated in collaborative group work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:53Z (GMT).

In order to investigate how young children engaged in engineering design, we presented 31 children (ages 8-9) from two third-grade classrooms with the task of constructing a pop-up book, (also called paper engineering). Here we report the results of a qualitative analysis of 29 children's semi-structured interviews in which they answered questions about their pop-up books post-construction. We found that children used troubleshooting and satisficing (among other techniques) to solve problems they experienced while constructing pop-up books. This research has implications for elementary grade engineering design instruction. In particular, it highlights the need to promote activity structures that foster a normative practice of troubleshooting.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:53Z (GMT).

Participants in urban and suburban schools used materials designed based on what is known about promoting student learning of science, and that link ideas within and across grade levels in a coherent manner. Using a cross- sectional approach, student learning was assessed using an independent measure aligned with a learning progression on the transformations of matter. To develop the learning progression and corresponding assessment, we used construct-center design. Using IRT and analysis of variance, we demonstrate that students' latent ability changes across grade level, illustrating that curriculum coherence can, indeed, support students in building understanding of core chemistry ideas. We also found that boys and girls did not perform differently, in contrast with other findings, particularly in urban U.S. middle schools, in which girls outperform boys.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:54Z (GMT).

We interviewed 20 technoathletes who were actively involved within either cycling or running communities. Qualitative vignettes of technoathletic engagement with data and the practice of data logging, in specific, are discussed and illustrated. Individual relationships that technoathletes have with their data are also examined. Through the examples, we highlight some commonalities in the data that were obtained and how various athletes represented that information. We also consider some of the tensions that technoathletes have with respect to the data they can obtain and how they saw themselves in light of their data and consider some implications for instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:55Z (GMT).

We also argue that teachers should play a more central role in analyzing learning data for the purpose of creating knowledge about how specific pedagogical and technical innovations play out in the context of specific classroom situations, and describe a new approach to teacher-led inquiry into students' learning data.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:55Z (GMT).

We analyzed 16 80-minute science lessons from 42 pre-service elementary teachers working in groups, in order to investigate ""teacher noticing and responding"" (TNR) abilities relating to student inquiry. Findings suggest that the pre-service teachers were able to identify and respond to a variety of aspects of their students' inquiry, although we identified disagreements between what they responded to and what we considered important aspects of student inquiry. These findings highlight an on- going disagreement with prior research, which suggests that teachers' TNR abilities develop with time and teaching experience.

Results showed that students showed improvement in certain cognitive understandings; acquired basic skills in using digital technology in inquiry activities; were confident in using digital technology in their learning; and felt that both inquiry learning and digital technologies can increase their interest in science learning.

Repertory Grid is a method for eliciting personal constructs of learners about elements belonging to the topic of study. The method of Repertory Grid is presented first followed by brief descriptions of two classroom studies and two eye-tracking controlled laboratory studies. Empirical findings contribute to a better understanding of the integration of Repertory Grid into teaching as an in-class learning activity or a take-home exercise, methodological support for teachers to designing and deploying RGT exercises, and computational support for visualizing the Repertory Grid data at the individual student level and whole classroom level for ""teaching analytics"" purposes. We outline the design and development of the Repertory Grids for Formative Assessment (RGFA) tool and conclude with directions for future work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:56Z (GMT).

Teams of students with greater initial intrinsic motivation or a greater increase in intrinsic motivation during the activity had higher programming scores. Wiki activity contributed to outcomes. Age was negatively associated with outcomes indicating possibly the program is more conducive to middle school students. Findings contribute to scholarly debates on incompatibilities between discovery learning due to cognitive load, and self-determination theory. Introduction This paper reports findings from the 2009/2010 school year of a Constructionist digital literacy project being conducted with students and educators in the state of West Virginia involving a state-wide network of classrooms engaged in game design learning and purposeful social media use among youth. Middle school, high school and community college students (N = 386) enroll in a blended learning game design elective course offered daily, for 1 or 2 semesters, credit and a grade. The paper explores teams' motivational orientation and active program work in relation to their learning outcomes, in the context of a guided discovery-based curriculum in which students and educators co-learn together in this social learning system. Literature Review Computational game making activities can enhance students' meta-cognition, self-regulation, and computational thinking (e.g., Harel &amp; Papert, 1991; Harel, 1991; Kafai, 1995; Kafai &amp; Ching, 1998; Papert, 1980). Research supporting these findings has been conducted under the educative ""framework for action"" Constructionism (Papert, 1980; Harel and Papert, 1991). Constructionism draws upon both Piaget's constructivist theory and Vygotsky's social constructivist theory. Adherents design and implement learning innovations and environments that foster learners' conscious creation of a meaningful, computational public artifact (e.g. a game), created and shared in a reflective, workshop environment of peer and expert-guided scaffolding (Harel and Papert, 1991). This study centers on a program of game design that employs a range of web 2.0 technologies including Flash and a wiki e-learning platform. In the co-learning model, the students engage in self-driven learning while their educators are still novices, using the provided resources. This activity can be characterized as guided discovery-based learning. Discovery-based learning While some argue that students can feel frustrated during discovery-based learning, others argue that students can enjoy it (Reynolds &amp; Harel Caperton, 2011). Reynolds &amp; Harel Caperton (2011) find contrasts in student perceptions of both enjoyment and challenge in the discovery-based context investigated here during the prior school year, given that occasionally novice learners must seek out learning supports to meet design needs in the moment. Kirschner, Sweller &amp; Clark (2006) criticize ""discovery-based learning"" for creating excessive cognitive load due to lack of structure and distraction in the search process that reduces student motivation. In contrast, self-determination theory (SDT, Deci &amp; Ryan, 2008) argues that three primary constructs underlie intrinsically motivated human behavior, and are innate needs: the need for autonomy (to have choice and control over one's life), for competence (to be effective), and for social relatedness (to feel connected to others, loved, and cared for) (Deci &amp; Ryan, 2008; Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000; Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985). Level of autonomy afforded by a given environment, and the intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientation of individuals play roles in their experience and fulfillment. Given the autonomy-supportiveness of the designed intervention, we propose the following hypotheses. Hypotheses. H1. Teams with higher mean intrinsic motivation have higher team scores. Given the guidance, scaffolding and support from both teachers and non-profit staff, along with resources provided in the blended e-learning environment, we expect that even those students who are more controlled in their self- regulation style will also succeed and perform well in the program because the necessary supports have been provided for those who might need them. H2. Teams with more extrinsically-oriented self-regulation have higher team scores. Furthermore, in addition to the generalized holistic inventories outlined above, student motivation towards the specific contextual range of activities in which they engage might be related to subsequent team scores. H3. Teams with greater increases in motivation towards program activities have higher team scores. Finally, given students' active engagement and use of a wiki, we explore the extent to which such activity may contribute to game design outcomes. H4. Teams with more wiki activity have higher team scores.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:57Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

(2) Are we putting our knowledge together? (3) How do ideas develop over time? (4) What is happening to my stuff? These questions are inspired by Scardamalia's knowledge-building principles. The KCA first converts a Knowledge Forum tuplestore database to SQL format, and then executes queries relevant to these four questions. It Students and their teacher can employ it to self-assess their knowledge building. This paper elaborates upon a conceptual framework underlying the system design, describes the KCA, and reports the results of several rounds of usability testing involving teachers and students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:57Z (GMT).

Research has shown that inclusion of argumentation tasks can improve these skills. We investigate alternative forms of argumentation scaffolds (to construct or evaluate an argument) integrated within physics problems, and their impact on students' solutions and argumentation quality. Results suggest that the scaffolds, not mere inclusion of argumentation, can improve students' argumentation skills. Additionally, in verbal and graphical representation problems, evaluation of an argument with prompts improves students' conceptual quality of the solutions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:58Z (GMT).

Grade 3 students participated in a year long course designed to foster mathematical reasoning. The course combined problem solving in dyads, peer argumentation and teacher-led discussions. We focus on one activity: identifying the types of solutions, the kinds of reasoning and the kinds of non-verbal actions (gestures, drawings, folding etc) used. We show how gestures and other non-verbal actions were interwoven with children's verbal peer argumentation and led them to new insights on the concept of area.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:58Z (GMT).

The children, matched by gender homogenously, are charged with completing a tangram puzzle on a SMART Table, a multi-touch tabletop that supports virtual manipulatives. Tasks are constrained by specific rules to encourage communication. Normally, collaboration can be investigated in terms of the task: did participants finish the puzzle efficiently? In contrast, we approach collaboration analytically as a way of acting. We define acting collaboratively as consistent alignment as to the focus of talk, and taking turns to complete the task while following the specified rules. We use the notion of metapragmatics to capture how a participant's actions (talk and gesture) are meaningful for the consequences of interaction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:03:59Z (GMT).

This approach, known as informant design approach, enables young people to draw on their cultural experiences in learning and gaming as resources for game development. In the three- year research and development project, we conducted five progressive informant design workshops with twenty adolescent learners, where their conceptions of earth science as well as ideas for game design are considered at its various stages of educational game development. Our findings from the qualitative analysis of video and artifacts draw attention to the learners' cultural models of learning and gaming and discuss the importance of engaging learners as informants of educational game design. Introduction Young people may often be thought to be ignorant of what is best for them. This paper attempts to position learners as the best resources in knowing what engages them in a learning environment, for educational game design. Such a disposition to game development is inspired by Gee's (2003) argument about cultural models and the role they play in learning. According to Gee (2003), cultural models are: stories or images of experience that people can tell themselves or simulate in their minds, stories and images that represent what they take to be ""normal"" or ""typical"" cases or situations ... We act with others and attempt to make sense of what they are doing and saying. We interact with the media of our society and attempt to make sense of what is said and done there, as well. (p. 146) Bartlett and Holland (2002) would concur that learners bring their cultural models to learning environments. Using the term ""cultural worlds"", Bartlett and Holland argue, ""cultural worlds are continuously figured in practice through the use of cultural artefacts or objects inscribed by the collective attribution of meaning"" (p.12). It was our aim to involve learners in our game design by providing them with opportunities to reflect on their cultural model of the way they think about learning and gaming and use their ""funds of knowledge"" (Gonzlez, Moll, &amp; Amanti, 2005) as resources for the design. In this paper, we describe how the design approach, known as the informant design approach, has helped us understand young people's cultural models of learning with games. In this approach, we were able to create commonalities of experiences among the learners so as to help them reflect upon their cultural models of learning and game play. We were also able to explore ways to better encourage learners to use their own funds of knowledge for learning and designing by crossing the boundaries between their formal classroom learning and their cultural practices. The findings highlight the use of their cultural models as resources for the design as well as their cultural models being challenged by the constraints of designing an ""educational"" game, which they also felt should be different from commercial games they were familiar with. Methodology: Informant Design Approach With the emergence of new technologies, how you learn in and out of the classroom is drastically changing. At the same time, today's youths are not only the users of emerging technologies but also creators of many contents occupying them. In recent years, the idea of involving the target users of educational resources or tools during the development stages has been cited as a more efficient approach in meeting the pedagogical needs of those who may use the resources or tools. Many studies have reported the merits of such an approach, namely to allow the users' contributions to be effected into the redesign processes (Scaife &amp; Rogers, 1999) to gain access to the first-hand knowledge of the users' needs and preferences (Antle, 2003; Scaife &amp; Rogers, 1999); to tap on the creativity of the users (Antle, 2003; Rudd, Colligan, &amp; Naik, 2006; Scaife &amp; Rogers, 1999); and to help very young children to express their ideas (Walsh et al., 2010). Of note is Facer and Williamson's (2004) argument that when co-designing educational technologies with their target users, the following benefits of such an approach are evident: ""(i) it offers first hand experience of the needs, interests and requirements of end-users; (ii) it enables developers to be surprised by users and to avoid creating formulaic work; (iii) it allows developers to avoid costly mistakes and identify design difficulties at an early stage; and (iv) it offers the opportunity to create resources that are embedded in teaching strategies and educational contexts, and which consequently, actually achieve their educational aims"" (p. 1). Depending on the roles of the young people, the processes are called user-centered design, participatory design, and informant design approaches (Facer &amp; Williamson, 2004).

Gestures are most often observed in social settings where two or more interlocutors are engaged in natural conversation. Empirical investigations, however, suggest that gestures also play a role in individual cognition. We conducted two experiments that investigated the functional role of gestures as a strategy for solving translation problems in organic chemistry. Gestured-instructions did not promote gesture-use as a strategy. Removing instructional diagrams from view did promote gesture use. Students who did gesture did not perform better than those who did not; however, students who received gestured-instructions appeared more likely to adopt the spatial perspective of the instructor.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:00Z (GMT).

As the amount of research on CSCL scripts grows, it is the right time for a meta-analytical integration of the results. Using a random effects model, this meta-analysis integrated effect sizes of 19 comparisons derived from 13 studies about CSCL scripts. The average effects of CSCL scripts on domain-specific as well as domain-general learning outcomes were estimated. Additionally the meta-analysis targeted the role of additional content support as a potential moderator. Results indicate that CSCL scripts have moderate effects on learning outcomes while additional content support positively influences the effectivity of CSCL scripts on domain-specific learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:00Z (GMT).

Relying on techniques of grounded theory and microanalysis of discourse, I addressed the question: How do students vary in their individual propensities for managing uncertainty they experience during collaborative academic tasks? In particular, I examined variation in the size and composition of the set of strategies from which students drew, changes in students' use of strategies across projects, and their willingness to entertain or take up uncertainty.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:01Z (GMT).

In this study, we adopt a complex systems perspective in helping students to learn about artificial selection by using an agent-based participatory simulation - Bird Breeder. Our goal is to identify the strategies students used when using this simulation, and investigate the kinds of abstractions they made about the underlying agent-level mechanisms and emerging population-level outcomes of the model. We answer these questions using data collected from three high school biology classes that used this simulation. Our findings indicate that Bird Breeder was effective in fostering learning about the agent-level mechanisms that drive artificial selection. In contrast, the effectiveness of Bird Breeder at helping students learn about population-level outcomes of artificial selection is less clear. The findings have provided insight into possible design revisions to this simulation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We have developed a flexible technology layer that supports the aggregation of peer responses, including the collection of student explanations and semantic tags. We investigate collaborative inquiry scripts and discuss how they must comprise both the (macro) scripts that are enacted over a long-term curriculum, and the (micro) scripts that are enacted in class. We outline our rationale for inquiry design in Physics, the role scripting and orchestration play in the successful implementation of this curriculum, the role of the ""smart classroom"" in their enactment, and three successive iterations of our curriculum. Knowledge Communities for 21st Century Learning As we move further into the ""knowledge age"" today's workplace is shaped by new technologies, where activities are increasingly data-driven, collaborative, and predicated on a set of fundamental skills commonly referred to as information literacies (Livingstone, 2008). This shift is particularly pronounced across STEM disciplines, where workplace practices are shifting towards large, data-intensive, multidisciplinary collaborations across ever-widening spatial and temporal scales (e.g., the Human Genome project). A theoretical perspective from the learning sciences that is well suited to learning and instruction in the knowledge age is that of knowledge communities, as exemplified by the Fostering Communities of Learners (FCL) project (Brown &amp; Campione, 1996), and Knowledge Building (Scardamalia &amp; Bereiter, 1996), amongst others. These researchers have advanced an epistemological perspective where students consider learning as a social process, and value the collective knowledge of their peers. Although difficult to enact (Sherin et al, 2004), the knowledge community approach has garnered renewed attention, partly as a result of Web 2.0 capabilities, which can support complex pedagogical constructs (Slotta &amp; Najafi, 2010). Using ""Web 2.0"" technologies, students are active participants in a knowledge community that is engaged in the production, aggregation, and assessment of science topics, with an emphasis on inquiry and collaboration (Peters &amp; Slotta, 2010). The socially-oriented process of adding of meta-data (tags) to user- contributed content can provide opportunities to reveal meaningful connections and flexible real-time representations (Mathes, 2004). However, questions still remain about how such collections of content can best serve student learning and foster knowledge communities. Reflection and scripting, are two important aspects of such research and will be discussed in the present paper","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

They averaged more diagrams, 14% more correct enn diagrams, and 9.4% more correct domain inferences when using the digital pen interface. An error analysis further revealed that construction of multiple diagrams effectively suppressed scoping errors (e.g. overgeneralizations), the most common inference error. Implications are discussed for designing educational interfaces that improve students' visual fluency skills and related reasoning abilities, especially in low performers. ntroduction and ypotheses ne important ob ective for the design of future educational interfaces is to stimulate basic thinking and reasoning, including reducing systematic errors that undermine cognition. Recent research has highlighted that digital pen interfaces can substantially facilitate thinking by supporting the expression of different types of representation (e.g., linguistic, diagram, symbol, number). They elicit 44% more nonlinguistic representations, like diagrams, compared with keyboard-based computer interfaces ( viatt, in press; viatt, iller &amp; Hodge, in press). iagramming can make information more visually available to think about, especially if it is well matched with a task domain and makes alternatives visually explicit (Bauer &amp; ohnson-Laird, 1993). ast research has revealed that communicating more nonlinguistic content simultaneously stimulates a 36% higher level of appropriate biology hypotheses. Furthermore, knowledge of students' level of nonlinguistic communication predicted 72% of the total variance in their idea production ( viatt, in press). Related findings demonstrated that students' active construction of diagrams and marks also were associated with 25-36% higher problem-solution scores, compared with matched problems in which students did no diagramming or marking ( viatt, in press). These findings support an Activity theory view that communicative activity directly mediates thought, if well matched with a task domain. They also emphasize the importance of designing educational interfaces that support nonlinguistic representations as an aid in thinking, especially spatial ones like diagrams. The current research specifically explores whether: A digital pen will elicit more diagrams and more correct enn diagrams, compared with a non-digital pen A digital pen will selectively stimulate a higher percentage of correct inferences when students diagram ultiple diagramming will suppress overgeneralization errors, improving inference accuracy ethods articipants were twenty-three low-performing English speakers between 18 and 24 years of age, half male and female. All were expert users of keyboard interfaces, but none had ever used a digital pen interface. They solved three-statement inference problems by producing as many valid conclusions as possible, half using an Anoto- based digital pen and paper interface and half using a regular pen and paper. Students learned that the digital pen was a computer that could interpret and transmit their writing, and they were shown its features and given practice using it. In one condition, they were told not to make an diagrams while working, and in another they were given a enn diagram tutorial and instructed to ""make one or more enn diagrams before solving the inference problems. Students worked alone and had 3 mins. per problem (for details, see viatt et al., in press). Scoring included the total number of diagrams drawn, total correct enn diagrams, percentage of correct enn diagrams, percentage of correct conceptual inferences, percentage of correct er atim inferences (i.e., correct inferences, given the diagram constructed), and inference errors (e.g., overgeneralizations). Inter- rater reliability averaged 81-99%. Students' averaged 50% correct inferences overall (range 21.1%-78.6%). Results and Discussion Compared with using a non-digital pen, when students used the digital pen interface they drew significantly more enn diagrams per problem by ilcoxon signed ranks test [[ = 1.17 v. 1.25; = 1.76, = 9, p &lt; .04, one- tailed]. They also constructed significantly more correct enn diagrams, ilcoxon [[ = 0.82 v. 1.03; = 2.16, = 16, p &lt; .016, one-tailed], and a higher percentage of correct enn diagrams, ilcoxon [69% v. 83%, respectively; = 1.84, = 15, p &lt; .033]. Figure 1 shows these differences in diagramming due to the tool used. Students' percentage of verbatim correct inferences averaged 89.2% versus 95.2% when using the regular and digital pen tools, a significant difference by ilcoxon = 1.73, = 12, p &lt; .042, one-tailed.

This design-based study investigated if a course designed based of this synthesized framework can help stimulate knowledge creation that is based on deepening understanding.

The four papers in this symposium discuss key issues, challenges, and progress around interest and engagement in science and math for students in grades 5 to 7. From a range of theoretical and methodological perspectives, the panelists discuss what interest and engagement are as research constructs; some of the design principles, key features of instructional materials, and contextual factors that trigger and shape interest and engagement; how learner characteristics influence the ways students select or respond to opportunities to engage; the roles that interest and engagement play in learning; and issues of measurement. This 90-minute session will include both formal presentations and moderated discussion among the panelists and audience.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:09Z (GMT).

Each teacher taught a science lesson at the beginning and at the end of the PDP. These were videotaped and analyzed in terms of the student inquiry the teachers responded to. Findings suggest that average student talk duration increased and students' leads were increasingly used to guide lesson flow. Teachers increased responses to students' reasoning and logic, offered more clarifications to students' ideas and reasoning, and decreased evaluations of students' ideas. However, teacher responses to knowledge claims increased and those to everyday experiences decreased.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:12Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Translational research often takes the world's natural variation as noise to be controlled so that the efficacy of an intervention is accurately judged. Translational research, while rigorous, often looses contact with local contexts. Action research takes as its raison d'tre creating the conditions for and the assessment of effectiveness within local contexts, but often is criticized for failing to produce generalizable knowledge. We propose educational improvement research as a middle course. Undergirded by principles from quality improvement and networked improvement communities (NIC), educational improvement research aims to remain connected to settings of practice while producing reliable knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:19Z (GMT).

Examples of such patterns are oscillation, equilibration, and threshold. Intuitions of these patterns can be leveraged in the design of constructivist science instruction. Clinical interviews elicit pattern intuitions by showing participants highly schematic simulations designed to illustrate each pattern. Participants are then prompted to generate examples of phenomena that follow each pattern. Preliminary analysis suggests that students have rich intuitive knowledge regarding general patterns that transcend various domains.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:22Z (GMT).

Robots can take the collaboration out of the computer and into the three dimensional, real world environments of students. This symposium raises the important question of how advanced technologies, such as robotics, may enable us to take the same insights from the area of scripted collaboration and use them to support groups of learners in these environments. Other topic areas include design choices in robotic features that may influence scripted interactions, social behavior, meaningful engagement, and conditions that dynamically support situational factors and generate collaborative learning among students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:23Z (GMT).

Students grew real bacteria, and then collaboratively designed a conceptual agent-based model of bacteria to mimic the observed growth. Observations and student notes suggest that the activity helped students demonstrate their knowledge of bacterial growth by formalizing it from a list of unorganized facts into an accurate pseudo-computational model. In completing their task, they also critically reflected on the assumptions built into the modeling activity itself, and demonstrated familiarity with some core principles of complex systems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:24Z (GMT).

Six posters highlight different facets of our effort, including descriptions of the immersive environment, the instructional narrative, the inquiry support technologies, the role of aggregate representations, discourse processes, and the classroom experiences of the 37 students and two teachers who participated in the unit.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:25Z (GMT).

All four papers presented focus on the interactional arrangements of social, cultural, and material supports for learning within contexts. The specific focus is on the social functions and social occasioning of practices across settings. The first two papers examine two common interactional arrangements--questioning and imitation--and the qualities of these arrangements across settings. The final two papers examine two common childhood activities in context--building with blocks and watching television--in order to understand how children engage in these activities and how that engagement is mediated by different interactional arrangements across settings. The combined effect of these papers is to begin to map the socio-material arrangements and interactional routines that contribute to young children's everyday learning, a neglected focus in the learning sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T22:04:27Z (GMT).
