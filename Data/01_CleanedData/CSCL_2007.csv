The papers presented as part of this symposium will focus on four different categories of analytic frameworks: (1) nature and function of contributions within the dialog, (2) nature of reasoning, (3) conceptual quality, and (4) patterns and trajectories of participant interaction. Example analytic frameworks from each category are presented in detail rich enough to illustrate their nature and structure. Synthetic discussions of each category consider the frameworks in light of the underlying theoretical perspectives on argumentation, pedagogical goals, and online environmental structures.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:00Z (GMT).

This paper reports on several sessions of mathematics problem solving in the VMT Chat environment. The VMT Chat is a synchronous chat and whiteboard space for students to collaboratively define and work on problems that are open-ended and that encourage students to define the questions themselves. We draw on the anthropological, psychological and sociological traditions and their concept of agency in order to produce a robust analysis of several segments of student work in the VMT Chat. Our analysis suggests that there are structural features to the VMT Chat environment that encourage ""agentic behavior"" on the part of students. This has important implications for learning and the structure of pedagogic activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Such a framework is important as a design process relevant to the work of CSCL. Any attempt trying to apply the traditional Instructional Design approaches (e.g., ADDIE) to social constructivist learning in CSCL contexts such as the community of learners approach is fundamentally flawed because the two stem from different assumptions of knowledge and philosophies of pedagogy. Based on a modified Activity Theory, we propose the ICAP (Identity, Community, Activity and Personal) design framework for social constructivist oriented approaches to educational design as an alternative to this mismatch. A case example of how ICAP is applied to designing a postgraduate degree program is reported.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Using dynamic multilevel analysis (DMA) and a structural equation model (SEM), this study analyzed 131 messages of 47 participants across seven topics in the mathematics forum of a university Bulletin Board System (BBS) Website. Results showed that a disagreement or contribution in the previous message yielded more disagreements and social cue displays in the current message. Unlike face-to-face discussions, online discussion messages that disagreed with a previous message elicited more responses. Together, these results suggest that teachers can use and manage online discussions to promote critical thinking, facilitate discussion of controversial topics, and reduce status effects.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:02Z (GMT).

This paper presents a theoretical framework for describing and understanding the processes which lead to collaborative knowledge building. The model borrows from the systemic approach of Luhmann as well as from Piaget's theory of equilibration. It describes people's learning activities as processes of externalization and internalization. Individual learning happens through internal processes of assimilation and accommodation, whereas changes in a wiki's information space are due to activities of external assimilation and external accommodation. All these equilibration activities are caused by subjectively perceived differences between an individuals' knowledge space and the wiki's information space. Differences of medium level are considered to cause cognitive conflicts which activate the described processes of equilibration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:03Z (GMT).

Finally, did student statements about the use and utility of anonymity match their actions? Analysis of the digital artifacts revealed no significant differences for use of names by activity or gender. Females more frequently made comments about wanting to be confident of their answers before they would attach their names. Males much more frequently expressed that anonymity was not important to them. Yet the use of names by the two groups across activities was virtually identical. Both groups had a use of names across all activities of approximately 60%.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:03Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In computer-mediated peer-tutoring for example it is more difficult to construct mutual models, thus impairing collaborators grounding, audience design and coordination. In this paper `Knowledge Mirroring`, that is providing information about the partner's knowledge, is introduced as technological support developed to compensate for these problems. Effects of Knowledge Mirroring on audience design and knowledge acquisition are studied in a simulated peer-tutoring scenario with explaining as basic activity. Analysis of explanations revealed audience design with respect to usage of elaborations and references. Results regarding knowledge acquisition show that learners provided with Knowledge Mirroring were able to draw more inferences on information distributed across the learning material.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:04Z (GMT).

Yet, to achieve rich, interactive, and creative collaborative learning settings CSCL tools need new flexible, dynamic and lightweight metaphors. This design tension between social and technology-mediated coordination is difficult to resolve and worthy of close analysis. In this paper, we study such a tension through the use of the Group Scribbles (GS) CSCL tool, developed at SRI International, a GUI-based approach that enables the creation and enactment of lightweight CSCL scenarios. The potential of GS, as well as its limita- tions and possible extensions are studied in relation to design scripts based on Collaborative Learning Flow Patterns. Preliminary experiences in an authentic environment illustrate several facets of the design tension, such as the participants' workload and awareness, or the adaptation to emergent situations. On the other hand, this study points out the need for a new flexible architec- ture that complements Group Scribbles.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:04Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this paper we analyze the cheat sites created by players for a teen virtual world called Whyville.net, which encourages youth ages 8-16 to participate in a range of social activities and play casual science games. Analysis of a sample of 257 cheat sites resulted in typologies for both the cheats and sites in terms of quality and quantity of science content. A case study of an especially active cheat site and analysis of player-written articles in Whyville's newspaper illuminate the illegitimate and legitimate aspects of cheating in this virtual world. Implications of these findings as cultural artifacts of the game community and as guides for designing informal online learning activities are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:05Z (GMT).

In our research, we've discovered that learners have a greater appreciation of what they are learning when we give them the goal of helping others outside their community. This appreciation is demonstrated by their willingness to jot down notes during activities and later write articles for an online cooking ""magazine."" The online cooking magazine has the potential to support learning and development of disposition toward scientific reasoning in several ways. It provides a place to hang scaffolding that promotes recognizing what's been learned, what led to successes, and how science contributed to those successes. It also provides a context for knowledge building in which learners create concrete artifacts they can share outside of the Kitchen Science Investigators community. We found that with computers in the kitchen and an online magazine to contribute to, participants were stopping and reflecting in ways that we had only seen previously when a facilitator was prompting them.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:06Z (GMT).

We do this by experimentally contrasting collaboration in two feedback configurations, one which is identical to the state-of-the-art in intelligent tutoring technology (Immediate Feedback), and one which is based on a long line of investigation of the use of worked out examples for instruction (Delayed Feedback). While our conclusions remain tentative due to the small sample size, the data reveal a consistent gender by condition interaction pattern across questionnaire, test, and discourse data in which male students prefer and benefit more from collaboration in the Immediate Feedback condition where they are more likely to take on the role of a help provider rather than a help receiver while the patterns is the opposite for females.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:07Z (GMT).

The ways in which reality TV fans engage as media producers parallels the ways in which researchers who study other new media such as video games describe the rich discourse, enduring community, and media mixing required to participate in these settings (Ito, in press; Steinkuehler, 2006). I argue here that the characterization of these worlds as communities of practice (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991), the dominant analytic framework for online communities, does not fully capture the way learning (and therefore becoming) happens in reality TV online communities and suggest ways to reframe this model. Finally, I propose directions for future research focused on understanding reality TV online fan communities as informal learning environments that require participants to engage in rich cognitive and sociocultural media literacy activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:07Z (GMT).

These include: greater ""sightlines"" into learner, teacher and peer cognition; an increasingly salient role for modeling; increased connectivity between people, concurrent with a greater sense of individualization or ""one-to-oneness""; fluid contextual mobility in learning, such as between virtual and real contexts or interoperability of individual, social and machine knowledge forms; and higher interactional bandwidth, or capacity of the environment to mediate meaningful content. Four grand challenges large, worthy, and difficult tasks should occupy the attention of the CSCL community. Each is a frontier: a more visible and vibrant role for the tools and metaphors of the CSCL community in a troubled era of globalization; means for extending collaboration beyond cognitive models to a broader range of human experience; vitality in learning and collaboration through the life cycle; and unlocking group ""flow"" in the science of collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:08Z (GMT).

In a 2x3 factorial design we varied the amount of support as well as the mode of communication in order to test the impact of the support on the collaboration process and performance in net-based interactive and non-interactive communication settings. The results showed an improved collaboration process in conditions with support but no significant effect on the performance measures. The support measures fostered the collaboration process even in the particularly difficult conditions with non-interactive communication.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:08Z (GMT).

But we believe this implicit learning assumption has not yet been as substantially researched or discussed as is warranted by its importance. Furthermore, little support has been implemented. In this symposium, in accordance with the conference theme which encourages us to explore interrelations among individual and social cognition with technology, we would help illuminate this hidden agenda. We would take some closer looks at cutting-edge research on knowledge integration of learning outcomes from different classes, across formal and informal learning settings, and for longer time periods than usually taken up by learning science research. We would then propose to define a new set of learning goals as assuring the portability, dependability, and sustainability of learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:08Z (GMT).

Computer-supported collaboration scripts generally suffer from the problem of being restrained to a specific learning platform and learning context. Researchers are therefore aiming for a formalization of collaboration scripts on both a conceptual and a computational level. A recently developed framework allows to describe collaboration scripts using a small number of components (participants, activities, roles, resources and groups) and mechanisms (task distribution, group formation and sequencing). Based on these, a formal, graphical modelling tool has been developed and tested with several example scripts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:09Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Analysis methods can be totally or partially supported by computer-based tools that provide for better and more efficient analysis processes. The current research in this field shows that most interaction analysis tools have been based on unstable prototypes, and are highly dependant on the learning environments and research goals for which they were defined. As a consequence, it is not possible to use them in authentic CSCL settings with real users. The goal of this European Research Team therefore is to utilize the synergies of experience in manual interaction analysis with computer-based analytical methods. In this article we present an approach that embeds standardized computer-supported techniques into a semi-formal analysis process model which can be utilized and adapted in a flexible way according to the cases and environments to be analysed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:09Z (GMT).

A correlation was also found between the readability of instructor messages and student messages. Consequently, the data suggest that a positive relationship exists between readability and the level of student online interactivity.

Two groups of teachers were studied: Novices and leaders in online instruction. Data-sources included interviews, researcher's journal and online activities developed by teachers. Findings indicate that leading teachers develop activities that better utilize the technology, require higher levels of thinking, better connect contents to student lives, and scaffold for rich artifacts. However, both groups scarcely utilize collaborative learning in their activities. We claim that this teacher-centered approach plays a critical role in preventing ""ordinary"" teachers from regular employment of online instruction.

Familiarity may have an impact on online collaboration, because it may help group members to progress more quickly through the stages of group development, and may lead to higher group cohesion. It was therefore hypothesized that increased familiarity would lead to (a) more critical and exploratory group norms, (b) more positive perceptions of online communication and collaboration, (c) more efficient and positive collaboration, and (d) better group performance. To investigate these hypotheses, 105 secondary education students collaborated in groups of three. The results of this study indicate that familiarity led to more critical and exploratory group norm perceptions, and more positive perceptions of online communication and collaboration. Furthermore, in familiar groups students needed to devote less time regulating their task-related activities. On the other hand, no effect of familiarity on group performance was found.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:11Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this paper I present preliminary findings from a field study of five newcomers in a research and development laboratory. The findings show that to move from peripheral to full participation newcomers make use of both interpersonal and technological resources available within the organization. In addition to these resources, newcomers' participation trajectories depend on experiences that they bring with when they enter the organization. These experiences provide templates that influence and shape consequent participation. The findings also suggest that as newcomers participate in a community they influence oldtimers as well as established practices in that community, suggesting that a community of practice undergoes changes as a result of newcomer participation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:11Z (GMT).

These silo-like structures lead to fragmentation, counteracting cross-community collaboration and interdisciplinary learning. We are revising our own online community software to support a particular sociotechnical pattern: the emergence of ""transcendent communities""--networks of participation that transcend collections of related but distinct communities. In order to understand such inter-community activity we have developed a theoretical analysis of the basis for individual action and how this action can lead to value for the larger community. Investigating the relationships between individual action, social affordances of the technology and group identities will help us to design for functionality and for meaning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:12Z (GMT).

While this research tradition is substantive and meaningful in its own right, we propose a line of inquiry that seeks to understand computer-supported, large-scale collective dynamics: how large groups of interacting people leverage technology to create emergent organizations (knowledge, structures, norms, values, etc.) at the collective level that are not reducible to any individual, e.g., Wikipedia, online communities etc. How does learning emerge in such large-scale collectives? Understanding the interactional dynamics of large-scale collectives is a critical and an open research question especially in an increasingly participatory, inter-connected, media-convergent culture of today. Recent CSCL research has alluded to this; we, however, develop the case further in terms of what it means for how one conceives learning, as well as methodologies for seeking understandings of how learning emerges in these large-scale networks. In the final analysis, we leverage complexity theory to advance computational agent-based models (ABMs) as part of an integrated, iteratively-validated phenomenological-ABM inquiry cycle to understand emergent phenomenon from the ""bottom up"".","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:12Z (GMT).

Analysis of the evolution of participation inequity (PI) in group discussions suggested that participation levels tended to get locked-in relatively early on in the discussion. Similarly, high (low) quality member contributions made earlier in a discussion did more good (harm) than those made later on. Both PI and differential impact of member contributions suggest a high sensitivity to early exchange; both significantly predicting the eventual group performance, as measured by solution quality. Consequently, eventual group performance could be predicted based on what happened in the first 30-40% of a discussion. In addition to theoretical and methodological implications, implications for scaffolding CSCL groups are drawn.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:12Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Within our analyses, we examined evidence for group self- regulation among two 4-person groups of sixth grade students while they worked on three different group activities as part of a mathematics unit on statistics and graphing. Results suggest that groups made consistent efforts at regulating their learning and engagement, but that the overall quality of group regulation varied. In addition, our findings support the application of the general categories of behavioral and cognitive regulation to regulatory processes in groups, but suggest that specific aspects of self-regulation may be especially important in group contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:14Z (GMT).

Scripts have repeatedly proven useful for guiding learners to engage in specific roles and activities in CSCL environments. The effective mechanisms of scripts in stimulating cognitive and collaborative processes, however, are not yet well understood. Moreover, scripts have been shown to be somewhat inflexible to variations in needs across individual learners, specific groups, and classroom constellations. In this symposium, we present research on how scripts impact socio- cognitive processes. The symposium additionally focuses on how CSCL environments can be orchestrated through flexible scripts that adapt to meet the special requirements at the classroom, small group, and individual levels.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:14Z (GMT).

Because (virtual) teams are complex, the types of interactions that suit a particular team may or may not be predictable.

When augmenting the classroom with handheld, wireless computing devices, handling peripheral participation becomes more difficult. The proposed new handheld network service, Look, allows a late overhearer, who has not witnessed the creation of common ground, to monitor the interaction between group members already engaged in a collaborative situated learning without interrupting.

As a prototypical situation of computer-supported information exchange, a shared- database setting was chosen for the current study. This information-exchange situation represented a social dilemma: while the contribution of information to a shared database induced costs and provided no benefit for the individual, the entire group suffered when all members decided to withhold information. In order to alleviate the information-exchange dilemma, a group-awareness tool was employed. It was hypothesized that participants would use group awareness for self- presentational purposes. For the examination of this assumption, the personality variable `protective self-presentation' (PSP) was measured. An interaction effect of group awareness and PSP was found: when an awareness tool provided information concerning the contribution behavior of each individual, this tool was used as a self-presentation opportunity. In order to understand this effect in more detail, single items of the PSP-scale were analyzed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In particular, it investigates the effects of a script (which supported the collaboration) and a content scheme (which fostered the focusing on the content) on transactivity in argumentation and on justifications of single arguments in the learning discourse and task solutions. Learners were asked to learn a theory individually before working on a task cooperatively. Altogether, 52 triads were randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2 (with/without script) x 2 (with/without content scheme)-factorial design. To measure the effects of the intervention, the argumentation in the learning discourse and in the task solutions was analyzed. Results show no effects of the script on transactive reactions, but small effects of the content scheme. The content scheme also influenced the construction of arguments with justifications positively. Justifications in task solutions were supported by script and content scheme.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:16Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The model of distributed shared sense-making incorporates mutually constitutive interactions among sense-making systems, among mental models of sense-making systems, and between sense-making systems and their mental models. The model provides an integrated theoretical framework to support empirical examination of interactions among humans, and among humans and their cultural tools--in particular, their technological tools. The study uses the proposed theoretical framework to interpret teacher-student developing interactions in a technology-rich middle-school science classroom over the course of a year of scaffolded introduction to inquiry-based science instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:16Z (GMT).

Productive discussions could be resulted even without the assistance of teachers, through the problematizing moves made by the students themselves. Students having more experience in knowledge building seemed to be better at initiating the problematizing moves. However, the initiation also requires the uptakes of other learners so that the inquiry could be sustained. There was evidence that the novice group learned to ask more questions in the discussions, but their questions could still not be qualified as problematizing moves, suggesting further guidance might be needed. Relevant issues such as culture, gender, and the concept of ""group"" in a CSCL context were also discussed in this paper.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:17Z (GMT).

About 40 graduate, and 260 undergraduate students participated in the study. Data-sources included collaborative and personal artifacts in the courses' sites (wikis, forums, and documents created by teams or individuals), researchers' reflective journal, surveys and interviews. We focus on the first design-principle, and show how learning was promoted by features designed according to this principle in each of the courses.

Although research in the fields of both conceptual change and collaborative learning are well documented, few studies examine the relations between computer support and collaborative conceptual change. This review addresses this issue and considers the potential of CSCL for promoting conceptual change. We first review the major findings in the fields of conceptual change and collaborative learning. We then review literature on CSCL and discuss why CSCL environments may help in overcoming barriers to collaborative conceptual change. Finally, implications are provided for future CSCL design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:19Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The current study advances our research by applying our methodology to pedagogy research: we investigate individual and social factors underlying outcomes of implementing collaborative- inquiry classroom practice. Using bifocal modeling (Blikstein &amp; Wilensky, 2006a), we juxtapose agent-based simulations of collaborative problem solving with real-classroom data of students' collaboration in a demographically diverse middle-school mathematics classroom (Abrahamson &amp; Wilensky, 2005b). We validate the computer model by comparing outcomes from running the simulation with outcomes of the real intervention. Findings are that collaboration pedagogy emphasizing group performance may forsake individual learning, because stable division-of-labor patterns emerge due to utilitarian preference of short-term production over long-term learning (Axelrod, 1997). The study may inform professional development and pedagogical policy (see interactive applet: http://ccl.northwestern.edu/research/conferences/CSCL2007/CSCL2007.html).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:20Z (GMT).

This article's goal is to propose such relations for a situation of collaborative design, mediated by computer and carried out at a distance. We will show two main relations that emerged from our corpus. Firstly, dialogue utterances between partners that have a dominant social aspect are positively related to the symmetry of the entire dyadic interaction in terms of partners' contributions. Secondly, dialogue utterances that predominantly deal with expressing what partners are doing is negatively related to the extent to which partners are aligned. This research also extends the field of applicability of the cooperative activity model proposed in Baker (2002).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:21Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We describe the use of the wiki in terms of how it supported orientations among students towards relevant competencies involved in fieldwork, and how teachers used it as a way of gaining access to students' work. We discuss these functionalities in relation to ethnomethodological work on learning-and-instruction, showing how wiki entries were used as references in students' and teachers' talk. Distributed activities were thereby made available for instructive practices, and the competencies involved in note taking and observation could be collaboratively oriented to. We thus show that although the wiki was a web based distributed tool, its primary pedagogical functionality lay in its being used as a resource in co- located face-to-face talk.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:21Z (GMT).

The results presented in this paper illustrate the effect team dynamics also have upon technology appropriation, by combining proven data-collection strategies and the use of a system that augments paper sketchbooks with multimedia capture and sharing capabilities. We analyze the relationships between students' design notebooks, questionnaires, and interview responses, class observations, and course performance. Our study found that students' use of collaborative tools increases when they believe their teammates to be equally engaged and involved in the project. Moreover, students engaged in successful collaborations are likely to take fewer notes than those involved in conflict-filled collaborations, and students with considerable experience working in groups may bypass critical steps in creating joint problem-solving spaces with each new group.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:21Z (GMT).

They received a set of reference cases and diagnosed new patient cases by ordering and considering the results of medical tests. Half of the participants faced a memory burden as they worked on an initial set of ten new patient diagnoses. Participants then taught a confederate how to perform diagnoses. Finally, two new diseases were introduced, and participants diagnosed five new patients. Participants were allowed to take notes throughout the study. Both the memory burden and the teaching demand led participants to create external representations. Representations used for initial diagnosis, but not for teaching, carried over into the final diagnosis set. Results show that creating a representation was initially inefficient, but led to better performance and learning when participants were asked to adapt to new diseases. Also, a much greater proportion of graduate students than undergraduates created representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Recently, the design of collaboration scripts is a new focus area within the CSCL community. In this paper, we present a method based on open e-learning standards to script peer assessment processes. A standard-compatible tool can help users to script various forms of peer assessment in a machine-interpretable form. Such peer assessment scripts then can be executed on todays open technical e-learning infrastructure. In comparison with typical software development approaches to support online peer assessment, this technical approach is more efficient and flexible.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:22Z (GMT).

A total of 39 dyads discussed the topic using either synchronous (chat) or asynchronous (discussion board) CMC, after which they collaboratively wrote an argumentative text in a synchronous groupware environment. It was hypothesized that synchronous CMC would stimulate deep argumentation because of feedback immediacy while asynchronous CMC would stimulate gathering arguments because it allows increased reflection time. Finally, the study sought to determine if students who argue well during a discussion also wrote better argumentative texts. The results obtained partly confirmed the expectations. Students using synchronous CMC argue in a more elaborated way than students using asynchronous CMC. However, in contrast to the hypothesis, students using asynchronous CMC produced more accurate argumentative texts. This study sheds light on how synchronous and asynchronous CMC will be suitable for specific collaborative learning processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:24Z (GMT).

To explain this, researchers have been suggested to investigate the interaction process occurring in the course of collaboration. Research on face-to-face (FTF) groups have provided clues as to what types of interaction are productive for learning, both at the individual and group level. However, the extent to which these findings apply to online groups is not yet clear. This paper reports a conceptual systematic review of recent studies of online synchronous learning groups. There is little evidence that the types of online interaction deemed favorable are actually associated with individual conceptual learning. These findings challenge the implicit assumption held by many educational technology designers. Implications for future research are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

I characterize the resulting conception for ideal mathematical proof activity combining two fundamentally different ways of knowing: a posteriori (or experimental/empirical) and a priori (or deductive/propositional). Obviously, such conception of proving is/will be central in designing proof tasks, thus shaping the mathematical discourse around proof within classrooms. Whether one considers participation within such discourse is simply an aid or tantamount to thinking, identifying the character of this discourse appears to be essential in order to examine the interrelationships between what is social and what is individual.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:27Z (GMT).

Although studies have established fine-grained analytic approaches to discourse or argumentation in CSCL environments, we still have difficulty with evaluating collective knowledge advancement. The Complex Network Theory would be a promising approach to challenging this difficulty. We can visualize a variety of network structures with identifying ideas as nodes, and co-presence of words as links. Several indices numerically inform us how a target network is structured. In this paper, we report our attempt to describe how the network of ideas represented in discourse is structured in CSCL environments and its relation to the network structure analysis.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:27Z (GMT).

Cognitive Load Theory correctly predicted that as interfaces departed more from familiar work practice, students experienced greater cognitive load and corresponding reductions in their expressive fluency and planning. The results of this study indicate that students' communication patterns and meta-cognitive control can be enhanced by pen-based interfaces dur- ing math problem solving activities. In addition, low-performing students do not automatically reap the same advantage as high performers when new interface tools are introduced, which means intervention may be required to avoid expanding the achievement gap between groups unless in- tervention is undertaken.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:28Z (GMT).

We analyze urban youths' media arts practices within the context of the design studio, particularly by focusing on how collaboration, computation, and creativity play out within this context. We utilize a mixed methods design that draws upon three approaches: (1) participant observations; (2) media arts object analyses; and (3) comparative in-depth case studies. Aspects of new literacy studies, social theories of literacy, and situated learning guide the methodology and interpretation in this study. Media arts projects like these are not well understood in the research literature but have the potential to teach us about learning and literacy in the age of multimedia.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:28Z (GMT).

A survey was distributed to 57 students enrolled in graduate-level distance education programs. Nine of these students participated in extensive interviews. The findings indicate that students experience subtle forms of competition while participating in their online courses. Most manifestations of competition appear to have few educational benefits. It is posited that marking schemes that focus on individual accomplishments may increase feelings of competition and undermine efforts to foster collaborative practices. To reduce the negative effects of competition, course instructors may need to develop assessment strategies that reward group, rather than individual, accomplishments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:29Z (GMT).

This is particularly problematic when collaboration and learning processes are studied in groups that work together over weeks, and months, as is increasingly the case. The quantitative method dominant in the social and learning sciences--variable-centered variance theory--is of limited value, so we argue, for studying change on longer time scales. We introduce event-centered process analysis as a more generally applicable approach, not only for quantitative analysis, but also for providing closer links between qualitative and quantitative research methods. We conclude with suggestions on how nomothetic, idiographic, and design-oriented research interests can become better integrated in CSCL.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:30Z (GMT).

We compared the quality of the collaborative process and the joint solution of interdisciplinary dyads of different expertise levels (advanced students, trainees, and experts) working on a patient case. To assess the quality of the collaborative process, a rating scheme developed by Meier et al. (in press) was used. Additionally, process log files measuring individual and joint time and number of work phases were gathered, and joint solutions were analyzed. As had been assumed, the experts scored lower than the less experienced dyads in most measures of collaborative process. Looking in more detail at the less experienced dyads revealed that the trainee dyads outperformed the student dyads in most of the process variables. Analyses of process logfiles revealed the same pattern regarding the number of phases used. The predictions for the quality of the joint solution were more difficult and the results for these variables more mixed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:31Z (GMT).

The process of constructing this shared understanding requires that each team member builds some kind of representation of the behavior, beliefs, knowledge or intentions of other group members. In two empirical studies, we measured the accuracy of the mutual model, i.e. the difference between what A believes B knows, has done or intends to do and what B actually knows, has done or intends to do. In both studies, we found a significant correlation between the accuracy of A's model of B and the accuracy of B's model of A. This leads us to think that the process of modeling one's partners does not simply reflect individual attitudes or skills but emerges as a property of group interactions. We describe on-going studies that explore these preliminary results.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:31Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The analysis deals with a core issue for CSCL; the mismatch between common measures for learning, which are based on individual traits and outcomes, and learning processes that are distributed across people and artifacts. Rather than bridge this mismatch through an assessment of group performance, we suggest that learning scientists consider assessing an individual's adaptive reorganization in a socio-technical system. We selected video game play as a context for looking at collaborative learning because it represents an emergent social activity young people commonly engage in. Additionally, recent claims that game play involves deep learning have not been thoroughly investigated with ethnographic research; this project begins to address that gap.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:32Z (GMT).

Findings suggested that while students were motivated to learn in CSCL environments, they had difficulties monitoring and sharing knowledge for their own understanding. Additionally, a great deal of teacher guidance was needed to encourage student participation in collaborative knowledge building processes. Overall, this study may imply that students at this early stage of schooling need more structured guidance to improve their understanding in CSCL environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:33Z (GMT).

The collaborative construction of shared meaning is a complex process that has not previously been analyzed in detail despite the fact that it is often acknowledged as being the distinguishing element in CSCL. Here, a three-minute excerpt from a discussion among three students is considered in some detail. The students are reflecting on their analysis of mathematical patterns in a synchronous online environment with text chat and a shared whiteboard. Several interaction methods and group cognitive processes are identified. The analysis suggests a number of conditions and preconditions of such interaction. These are necessary for achieving the potential of CSCL as the accomplishment of high-order cognitive tasks by small groups of learners. An understanding of the conditions and preconditions of the small-group meaning-making process may aid in the design and analysis of CSCL activities, as well as in the development of a theory of group cognition.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:33Z (GMT).

Better understanding of the content is supposed to improve the quality of argumentation in the discussions. Although plausible, empirical tests of these assumptions are sparse. Therefore, the goals of this study are to examine these assumptions and to provide analyses of cognitive processes during collaboration. A one-factorial design with forty-eight (48) participants was used to investigate the relation between the formal quality of single arguments (low vs. high) during online discussions of groups of three, cognitive processes, and knowledge acquisition. The formal quality of single arguments was fostered by means of a computer- supported collaboration script. Empirical evidence was found that the quality of argumentative knowledge construction during discussion is positively related to deep cognitive processing and that the scripted construction of single arguments had a positive effect on the individual acquisition of knowledge on argumentation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:34Z (GMT).

Multilevel analysis techniques were used to understand how the provision of metanavigation support to groups interact with group navigation behavior and learner's metacognitive awareness of reading strategies to affect individual learning. The findings of this study revealed that providing metanavigation support to the groups contributed positively in enabling students to gain a rich understanding of domain knowledge.

Different analytic approaches produce complementary insights, but comparison is hampered by incompatible representations of the object of study. Sequential interaction analysis is promising but must be scaled to distributed and asynchronously mediated settings. Building on recent analytic work within our laboratory, we propose a framework for analysis that is founded on the concepts of media coordinations and uptake, and utilizes an abstract transcript representation, the dependency graph, that is suitable for use by multiple analytical traditions and supports examination of sequential structure at larger scales.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:36Z (GMT).

Results showed that users of conceptual representations created more hypotheses earlier in the experimental sessions and elaborated on hypotheses more than users of threaded discussions. Participants using conceptual representations were more likely to converge on the same conclusion and scored higher on post-test questions that required integration of information distributed across dyads in a hidden profile design. However, the essay contents and post-test offered no evidence for differences in information sharing in itself. These results were most consistent when a knowledge map with embedded notes was the primary means of interaction rather than when it augmented a threaded discussion.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:37Z (GMT).

Fifty-two high school students and 74 undergraduates completed a questionnaire on preference for argumentative texts or diagrams with different levels of difficulty. The high school students were also asked to construct texts and diagrams. Results show that preference for textual or diagrammatic representation depends on the level of difficulty of the represented information. The results suggest that learning with argumentative diagrams is only perceived to be beneficial with a medium level of information complexity. Sub optimal diagram construction in our previous studies on computer-supported collaborative learning may have been due to the complexity of the information.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:38Z (GMT).

This research direction has received relatively little attention within the CSCL community. In this paper we explore the possibilities of collaborative technology in the classroom. We use the distinction between task-related and social-emotional interactions as a criterion for computer support. It is hypothesized that the students will use the collaborative technology purely for task-related interactions when the characteristics of the tool closely match the conditions for an effective task performance. It is assumed that these task-related interactions stimulate knowledge elaboration and learning within the student group. Our findings indicate that all computer- mediated interactions were task-related and facilitated knowledge elaboration. Oral communication was about the social-emotional aspects of the collaboration, and the planning and regulation of the collaborative activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:39Z (GMT).

We have analyzed the data collected from two sets of participants where one set was facilitated by only the teacher in their explanation efforts and the other set was facilitated by both the teacher and our software called SHADE. Results indicate that participants who used the software engaged in higher quality explanatory discourse by the end of the unit.

This paper presents results from a controlled experiment in which we investigate the affect on productivity and learning from doing idea generation tasks individually versus in pairs, with versus without automatic support from a virtual brainstorming agent called VIBRANT. Our finding is that individuals brainstorming with VIBRANT produced more ideas than individuals who brainstormed with a human peer. However, an additional finding is that while brainstorming in pairs lead to short term process losses in terms of idea generation, with a corresponding reduction in learning in terms of pre to post test gains, it produced a productivity gain for a subsequent distinct individual inquiry task. Furthermore, automatically generated feedback from VIBRANT improved learning during idea generation but did not mitigate the process losses that were associated with reduced learning in the pairs conditions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:41Z (GMT).

Accordingly, without further support, e. g. by distributed monitoring by a learning partner, fading may be ineffective. Therefore we examined whether fading fosters skill acquisition only in combination with collaborative support. In an expe- rimental study with the factors fading and distributed monitoring, learners were supported in an online discussion forum by a collaboration script for the production of counterarguments. Results show that fading fostered the acquisition of declarative knowledge about argumentation only in combination with distributed monitoring, whereas with regard to procedural knowledge about ar- gumentation there were no differences. These results indicate that fading supported by aspects of computer-supported collaboration can increase the effectiveness of fading for skill acquisition even in early stages of skill acquisition.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:41Z (GMT).

We developed a coding scheme for coordination processes containing 25 different coding categories, and used it to analyze chat data gathered in a semester- long education course. In general, we found a high level of coordination throughout the chat logs. The level of goal-related coordination (goal-related vs. not goal-related) varied extensively, depending on the specific task type. Based on an initial process analysis, a time pattern with regard to coordination levels was identified. We surmised that the amount of goal-related coordination and the point in time in which it occurs might play a role in coordination behavior. However, strong intra- and interindividual differences prevented us from detecting a distinct coordination pattern by numerical means over time. We conclude by proposing an extension of our analysis across media type and task type to detect coordination patterns relevant for collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:41Z (GMT).

Main insights included a relatively low but stable continuity of individuals in the community, increasing international participation and increasing connectivity across different countries. Concerning the disciplines involved in CSCL and the disciplinary backgrounds of CSCL community members it was found that a variety of disciplines are represented in the community. A detailed analysis of the way these disciplines contribute to the progress of CSCL, the way members with different disciplinary backgrounds collaborate is still missing. In this paper we report an analysis of the CSCL community with respect to the disciplinary background of its members and the interrelation of various disciplines in CSCL. The analysis is based on a survey among members of the CSCL community actively involved in the CSCL 2007 conference (reviewers and authors of accepted contributions). The paper reports and discusses main results of this analysis with respect to disciplinary background of CSCL community members as well as links between the disciplines. In addition it provides insights into motives for interdisciplinary collaboration, beneficial and hindering factors. The results should help to sharpen our view of the CSCL community, contribute to a shared understanding about what CSCL (currently) is (and what is it not) and point out perspectives for future development of the CSCL community.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:42Z (GMT).

Teacher attrition results in part from frustration caused by inadequate preparation and lack of a professional development support system. Beginning teachers lack access to exemplars of effective teaching practices. This paper proposes a design framework addressing these problems via a free Internet-based resource for teachers to share videos of their teaching practices and exchange ideas through a supportive online community. This resource would present easily accessible videos of model practices, problem representations, problem solutions. The website would provide a supportive community for beginning teachers; enable them to: form groups centered on common interests, exchange messages, and offer one another feedback on teaching practices; facilitate sharing of classroom materials and best practices; and allow teachers to post profiles of professional and personal information.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:43Z (GMT).

Analysis of videotaped interactions and pre- and posttests clarified the following three points. (1) Students who used CarettaKids presented the simulation results and rules for object arrangement they worked out individually in their respective personal space, by using CarettaKids' function of projecting object arrangements and simulation results from a personal digital assistant onto a sensing board. (2) Many of the students who used CarettaKids examined individually generated ideas collaboratively in the shared space. The patterns of collaborative examination are: (a) Induce a rule for object arrangement from object arrangements devised in personal spaces; (b) Deduce a new object arrangement from the rules discovered in the personal spaces; and (c) Refine the rules discovered in the personal spaces through group discussion. (3) Students who used CarettaKids not only considered all of the three factors, i.e. residential area, industrial area and forest area, but also understood relations between these factors, thereby deepening their understanding of city planning that takes environmental and financial aspects into consideration. We suggest that the degree to which students deepen their understanding is affected by the presence or absence of collaborative examination of individually generated ideas in the shared space.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:44Z (GMT).

We analyze examples of these tensions from our own research in an after-school, design research program and relate them to findings from other research that explored using collaborative learning systems in classrooms. We apply dialogism to describe factors that contribute to students' perception of these classroom experiences as ones that do or do not foster collaboration, including the culture of the classroom, the affordances of the technologies used to mediate collaboration, and the role of multivocality in the classroom. Students are using, reusing, and appropriating media in creative ways outside of their school settings while teachers are increasingly incorporating related emerging technologies such as wikis, blogs, and chat rooms into their classrooms. By understanding the factors that contribute to dialogism, educators will be better equipped to create classroom cultures and design environments to encourage collaboration among students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:44Z (GMT).

However, these activities have not been well investigated in CSCL research. We have studied information behavior of small groups of middle school students engaged in online math problem solving. More specifically, we examined how participants negotiate and co- construct their information needs, how they seek information, and how they make sense of discovered information. We argue that for learners in a CSCL environment, information is essentially a social achievement that emerges through the interactions of the group. Information only becomes information for participants when it is interactionally constructed to be meaningful and intelligible in their local situation. Analyzing learners' information behavior from such an interactional perspective can help us understand their practices of doing collaboration and learning. This has significant implications for designing CSCL environments and information resources to support small groups' information behavior and collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T18:38:46Z (GMT).
