The study explores the benefits of learning science concepts before or during a design project. Based on the NGSS science and engineering practices, in an engineering condition, students learn the necessary science concepts during a design project. In a science condition, students learn the science concepts first, then apply them during a design project. The study explores the benefits of each approach to inform instructional design. We use the knowledge integration framework to develop curriculum and assessment items, including an interactive computer model of a solar oven. Using three types of pre/posttest assessment items, we found students in both conditions gained insights on science and engineering design items; students in the engineering condition outperformed the science condition on a science-design integration item and conducted more trials during the design process while using an interactive computer model.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:04Z (GMT).

Core research questions included i) What are the challenges in designing a robot to mediate equitable, collaborative interactions among young children? and ii) What themes arise in children's interactions with the robot and each other? We adopted a design research approach to developing interaction episodes and the robot's mediating utterances, where our designs were continuously revised as we observed triadic interactions in a natural kindergarten setting. This paper discusses our design experiences, as well as themes that emerged from ethnographic observations over a four-month period.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:05Z (GMT).

These efforts are generally organized in the form of innovation/implementation networks (DBIN). While the network as a whole can be successful, implementations in individual schools differ, resulting in large variations in the depth and reach of the changes that take place at the school level. This study investigates two schools in a DBIN that demonstrated similar trajectories of change in the first two years, but very different outcomes at the end of the third year. The findings show that the fine grain details of the architecture for and leadership engagement in within- and cross-school learning, and the quality of the school-based learning interactions matter in determining the implementation outcomes of schools in the same DBIN.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:05Z (GMT).

Yet teacher awareness tools are not commonly optimized to guide teacher behavior in ways that are productive for learning. In this paper, we introduce Causal Alignment Analysis (CAA), a framework for data-informed,iterative design of teacher awareness tools, which links the design of awareness tools to educational goals. We illustrate the usefulness of CAA with a case study, demonstrating the successful design alignment of an awareness tool with a causal path from teacher tool use to student learning. Over a sequence of four pilot studies conducted in both simulated and live classrooms, we demonstrate the iterative refinement of Lumilo, a real-time awareness tool, to draw teachers’ attention towards students who may benefit most from a teacher’s help.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:06Z (GMT).

Three case studies show how, through participation in outreach, undergraduate instructors from groups historically underrepresented in STEM are positioned as neuroscientists and gain professional skills which contribute to the development of their personal and professional identities in their STEM field.

In this study, an e-learning environment was developed in line with the four component instructional design (4C/ID) model. The four components consist of authentic problem-based tasks (i.e., learning tasks), various support (i.e., supportive and procedural information) and additional drill-and practice exercises (i.e., part-task practice). This study firstly investigates the influence of students’ prior knowledge, task value and self-efficacy on students’ use of the components. Secondly, it examines the influence of students’ use of the components on their learning gain, taking into account their characteristics. Results of 161 students reveal a significantly negative influence of prior knowledge on students’ use of learning tasks and part-task-practice, whereas task value has a significantly positive influence on use of learning tasks and supportive information. Furthermore, use of learning tasks, procedural information and students’ prior knowledge significantly contribute to students’ learning gain.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:07Z (GMT).

The design was guided by cognitive research that recognizes both the psychological and social aspects of learning. The outcomes represent both research findings across 14 participating classes as well as a more specific look at the activities of one student group, documenting their experience and perspectives in-situ. Data gathered include interviews, usage logs, student notes and student final projects. All interviews and video recordings were transcribed, indexed and underwent inductive content analysis to identify key themes around motivation to learn and explicit learnings and negotiations with the app. Our findings suggest that AR can facilitate and sustain an inquiry through making the invisible visible in authentic and challenging settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:07Z (GMT).

However, when there is insufficient time or money to conduct a detailed trial of each proposed innovation, are there other less resource intensive methods that can be used? Here, we present a study conducted with thirty-six learning sciences experts and practitioners who were asked to judge the potential effectiveness of eighty collaborative learning activities using an adaptive comparative judgment (ACJ) approach. The results of the ACJ process show that the most innovative and effective collaborative learning activities are those that are monitored but not formally assessed. In addition, the use of technology and explicit support of students’ social and problem-solving skills are identified as important features of innovative collaborative learning activities that are likely to be effective. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents features of innovative collaborative learning practice that are considered to be important for effectiveness by experts. Second, it provides an ‘innovative’ research approach to assess educational practice when teaching is considered as a design science rather than a theoretical science.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:08Z (GMT).

Often in technology enhanced learning situations, information from the system provides discrete data points that can be used to infer learning without providing much information on the knowledge construction. On the other hand, analysis of student dialogues can be time consuming and subjective. In this paper, we propose combining log data, student dialogue, and gaze analysis to provide a clearer picture of how students construct knowledge collaboratively while working with an intelligent tutoring system. We found that students’ gaze similarity is negatively correlated with levels of abstraction in speech and that students have higher gaze similarity surrounding feedback provided by the tutor. These results show that the gaze data can be used as a proxy for dialogue in a collaborative learning context.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We developed case studies of two groups of students who incorporated culture into their community tours of a tribally-owned golf course complex and stadium complex to address the following question: How did small groups of youth conceptualize culture and how did they integrate it into their community tours? In the discussion, we address what can we learn from youths' design processes and completed products about designing culturally responsive learning experiences.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:09Z (GMT).

Much of this research has focused on factors that affect team processes and outcomes, such as the use of team performance visualization tools. Such tools are also valuable to researchers who make inferences from team data or educators who assess teams and plan interventions. This variety of users suggests that studying these tools requires a user-centered approach focusing on affordance relationships. In this paper, we use Epistemic Network Analysis to create a visual representation of the space of affordance relationships for extant team performance visualization tools. We use this space to compare tools, and to demonstrate empirically the dimensions along which they differ. These dimensions suggest a preliminary taxonomy of tools in terms of their affordance relationships for different users.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:09Z (GMT).

In this study, we leverage a design experiment developed with two low-income neighborhoods, to facilitate science learning across the everyday settings of these communities. We focus our analysis here, on how different actors facilitated a common practice that arose organically – probing learners for their understanding – and how that practice moved across different social and material configurations of the neighborhoods. As this practice was taken up by different actors – teachers, parents, and others – we observed the different variations of this practice that learners may experience. By understanding practices on the move, we argue that smart and connected learning ecosystems will require more nuanced noticing, coordination, and layering of different flavors of a practice that can be taken up by a network of actors.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:10Z (GMT).

While studies have looked at how programs prepare teachers to teach for social justice, they tend to focus on teachers’ beliefs and few examine teacher education programs as a whole. Urban teacher residency programs have emerged as hybrid spaces addressing the disconnect between campus courses and field experiences, attempting to support teachers applying theory to practice. This study follows a cohort of pre-service science teachers in an urban teacher residency program over the course of their 18-month teacher preparation program. We analyzed written artifacts collected throughout the year to examine the evolution of their definitions of and practices related to social justice. We present two contrasting case studies to highlight their divergent learning pathways and the specific residency program experiences that influenced their learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:10Z (GMT).

In this paper we consider portfolios as a way to document and assess students’ learning processes in the context of designing electronic textile (e-textile) projects. We describe students’ use of portfolios at the end of an introductory computing course, Exploring Computer Science, during which 33 students created a series of electronic textile (e-textile) projects as part of a new curricular unit. Our analysis not only illuminates the capability of portfolios to capture computational practices and certain concepts, but also reveals students’ lack of effective use of non-textual evidence in their narrations. We consider the affordances and limitations of portfolios for supporting student reflection and metacognition of their own learning as well improvements that could be made to scaffold students’ communication and use of visual evidence in more effective ways.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:10Z (GMT).

While previous conceptual change instruction has focused on classroom-based environments, this study designed an online activity that identified misconceptions with a retrieval-practice task and compared the effects of subsequent self-explanation and instructional explanation prompts on knowledge revision. Results indicated that the retrieval practice activity induced cognitive conflict in learners who had misconceptions, and learners who received subsequent prompts to explain the correct answers had significantly higher posttest scores than students who read refuting explanations. We suggest that self-explaining is a particularly effective revision task for online Biology courses, where students may not actively engage with the refuting explanations that are used in classroom-based conceptual change instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:11Z (GMT).

Part of the popularity of social robots is their ability to utilize social channels of communication to foster productive social experiences, interactions which help individuals grow and develop. Teachable robots have potential to utilize social channels of communication to create social experiences which can help learners develop self-efficacy, an individual’s belief in their ability to succeed. In this paper, we present a fully autonomous robot for middle school math; we iterate through three design phases and analyze responses to identify how to better foster productive social experiences for self-efficacy. We report six design recommendations; for example, for low self-efficacy individuals, an ideal design should incorporate problem-solving statements and positivity to foster social experiences of mastery and social persuasion.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:11Z (GMT).

Families’ uses of new technologies present questions and opportunities for research at the intersection of family life, learning, and technology. With so much to do, how do families make use of emerging technologies to accomplish everyday tasks? Drawing on an ethnography of families’ media engagement, this paper examines the nature of young people’s assigned tasks at home. Through analysis of interactions between children, parents, the home setting, and material resources, we develop a theory of learning that accounts for how newer and older technological forms are reassembled in everyday tasks like homework and chores. We discuss how, through mixing media, repurposing space, and remote assistance families make home “work” with technology. These reassembly processes collapse tools, nesting old and new media together in ways that are increasingly relevant for designing learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:12Z (GMT).

As states and school districts are assuming responsibility for the new standards, there are few professional development (PD) models for how to help working teachers meet these challenges. This study presents an analysis of teachers’ practice in the second of three years of professional development aimed at helping them learn to enact instruction aligned with the NGSS. The analysis focuses on changes to how teachers organize whole class discussions, looking particularly at how teachers support student-student dialogue. Comparing discussions from spot observations of teaching to PD-supported lessons, data suggest teachers struggle in both contexts to support productive student-student talk, although they are modestly more successful in the PD context. Conclusions from this analysis include that PD should provide clear models of productive discourse.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:12Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Although students are able to engage in many aspects of scientific practices effectively, we know less about students’ ability to develop and use epistemic criteria. In this paper we discuss a model-based inquiry intervention with seventh grade students in which students developed and used epistemic criteria when evaluating models. We explored students’ use of epistemic criteria before and after the intervention. We found that students were able to generate and use a variety of epistemic criteria even before the intervention. Yet they improved in their ability to invoke fit-with-evidence as an epistemic criterion, a central criterion in modeling and argumentation. Our data suggest that students developed in their understanding of which criteria are prioritized in scientific practice—i.e., a meta-epistemic understanding of the utility and importance of epistemic criteria.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:12Z (GMT).

The museum is the Baba Nyonya Heritage Museum in Malacca, Malaysia. We created a number of public interactive installations designed to facilitate inter-cultural and inter-generational dialogues about cultural identity. The technology employed mixed and augmented reality techniques and gesture recognition to enable visitors to have a multisensory experience with the artefacts on display. Analysis of pre- to post-test knowledge based surveys showed significant learning gains as a result of interacting with the exhibits. Surveys of visitors' attitudes showed that they felt they had benefitted from the physical interactivity. Qualitative analysis of observational and video data showed that the different interaction techniques provided both benefits and challenges for interaction, which we reflect upon in the paper.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:13Z (GMT).

Qualitative analyses of observation notes, classroom videos, teacher reflective journal, and student artifacts elaborated the reflective processes and interactive roles of the teacher and her students to co-frame shared directions of inquiry as the knowledge building unfolded. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of students’ survey, interview, research journeys, and online discourse showed how the reflective structuration of epistemic objects helped to sustain and deepen their inquiry over time. These results, together with findings from our previous studies, shed light on agency-driven reflective structuration as a self-sustaining mechanism to guide and sustain principle-based knowledge building practices without extensive pre-scripting.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:13Z (GMT).

Badges are helping facilitate broader shifts away from measuring, accrediting, and credentialing achievement and towards capturing, validating, and recognizing learning. A study of 30 funded efforts to develop badges found that none of the efforts to develop competency badges (for demonstration of specific competencies) resulted in thriving badge-based ecosystems, while four of the five efforts to develop participation badges (for engaged participation in social learning) resulted in thriving ecosystems. The findings were more mixed for the remaining efforts to develop completion badges (for individuals completing projects or investigations) and hybrid badges (for multiple types of learning). This suggests that innovators temper their ambition for capturing and recognizing evidence of individual competencies, and consider exploring more social assessments and informal and crowdsourced recognition","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:14Z (GMT).

Prior work has identified a number of contributing factors for the persistence of the divide, including environmental cues, software themes, and course content. More recently, the design of software and hardware tools have been investigated as potentially contributing to the gender gap, and a new class of tools designed with gender in mind have risen to prominence. This study compared one such tool-the Adafruit Flora, an electronic textiles platform-to a comparable platform that was not designed with gender in mind-the Arduino Leonardo. While there were some shifts in self-identification, the most notable result was that the participants' views of computing and arts became less stereotyped. However, there was no meaningful difference between workshops in this regard. Our results indicate that the relationship between e-textiles and gender may be more complicated than previously thought.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:14Z (GMT).

LPs take a developmental approach to learning and assume that there are constraints that drive the learning paths. The question then is: how strong are the constraints of the learning process? We report on a comparison of two distinct instructional interventions informed by the same genetics progression that were implemented with introductory biology students (10th and 11th grades). The interventions targeted the ideas in the LP but differ in the: (1) sequencing of instruction, (2) focus phenomena, and (3) activities. To determine the learning paths for each instructional intervention we used causal model search and path analyses to explore relationships within and between these ideas. Our findings may indicate that the two instructional contexts result in maps that have both differences and similarities providing further evidence about the strengths of conjectures in LPs.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:15Z (GMT).

We investigated the merit of critique in promoting revision. 315 students participated in an online genetics unit where we investigated how critique affects the nature and frequency of revisions made to student essays. Students in the critique condition explain what is wrong or missing from several common non-normative student ideas regarding difficult topics in genetics. We compare this to a method used in the past to encourage students to add new ideas to their essays; students in the revisit condition are directed back to relevant information and interactive models rather than practicing critique. Students in the critique condition were more likely to revise their essays at all, especially students with low prior knowledge. Students that practiced critique were also significantly more likely to add new ideas to their revisions.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In order to build local, grounded knowledge about college writers and transitions, we invited a group of local secondary English teachers and college writing instructors to a series of School-University Dialogues.

Yet, in the years since their writing, the field has advanced significantly in its articulation of power in relation to learning. Students’ disciplinary engagement is not only dependent on how they author, share or convince others of their ideas, but also how such practices invoke issues of power. This suggests a need to revise the framework to engage specifically with what are now readily understood as racialized, classed, and gendered dimensions of learning. In this paper, we bring the issues of power to the forefront to explore the equity potential of the PDE framework. This preliminary move – which centers on the promise of positioning as a principle – is a starting point for the field in working toward a more integrated understanding of power and disciplinary learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:16Z (GMT).

This poses major challenges on the design of tools to support science inquiry. We developed a novel hybrid technology for biology classrooms that combines remote laboratories with modeling tools. How to design such systems is of fundamental importance because the design influences students’ learning processes (deJong, Linn & Zacharia, 2013). We examined the impact of the design of the modeling interface on learning, using two designs that differ in the type of visual feedback and the degrees of freedom for exploration. We found that neither of the designs was categorically better; rather, they were conducive to different forms of engagement in the inquiry activity, each offering distinct affordances for learning. This suggests that designers of technology for science inquiry need to be explicit about desired learning goals and forms of engagement.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:16Z (GMT).

The authors employ Sfard’s (2008) commognitive framework to conduct a detailed examination of mentor-mentee interactions in order to uncover mechanisms of disciplinary learning. Findings suggest that youth can pick up aspects of discourse relatively quickly, but that negotiating discourses in real time can be challenging for both youth and mentors.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:16Z (GMT).

In this study, using qualitative and quantitative analysis as well as data mining techniques, we investigated what promotes meaningful interaction between students when conducting collaborative inquiry. One hundred and fifty-six students from five high schools and colleges in the United States worked in groups of three to solve electronics tasks with increasing complexity in a virtual environment called Teaching Teamwork. The results showed that when the groups successfully solved the tasks, they showed statistically significant higher proposition generation, regulation and sustaining mutual understanding; when they did not solve the tasks, they showed significantly higher orientation, interpretation and conclusion.

High school teachers (N=928) responded to a survey that consisted of measures of their pedagogical beliefs, beliefs towards technology, and perceived training effectiveness. A series of multilevel models were used to explore the independent effects of these factors on teacher use of technology in general and for different teaching purposes. The results showed that teachers’ technology self-efficacy was a significant predictor of teacher use of technology in general. More importantly, teachers’ instructional approach and openness towards technology were more salient when predicting teacher use technology to support student-centered teaching. Our findings suggest that teachers’ pedagogical readiness is as important as technological readiness for technology integration in teaching to serve more advanced teaching purposes.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:17Z (GMT).

More specifically, we explore the CT-STEM practices that emerged as a result of students' participation in a two-day biology lesson featuring the exploration of a computational model on predator-prey dynamics. Digitally recorded data were taken from seventy-six students across four classes of one teacher. By applying a grounded analysis to students' written responses to two different assessment items embedded within the lesson, we found four CT-STEM practices related to identifying a model's limitations and eight practices related to exploring the model. Applying a network analysis to responses coded for these practices, we found networks representing common patterns of practices-in-use. This work identifies the informal CT-STEM practices that students bring to their learning and models combinations of practices-in-use.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:18Z (GMT).

The key designs included students engaging in idea-driven discourse on Knowledge Forum augmented with epistemic talk and reflection, and linking the understanding of their own inquiry process with scientists’ inquiry. Results indicated that students changed towards more sophisticated views of science from concrete-absolutist to evolving views of science.  Analysis of classroom events illustrated how students reflected on their inquiry and KF discourse in relation to epistemic features of scientific practice, and developing the notions that they can be little scientists emulating the practice of scientists.

Drawing upon a mobilities of learning framework and four years of ethnographic data across two making spaces (41 youth maker projects), we found that as youth engaged with community across their making efforts, they foregrounded their relationality to communities in their design work, both within activities and across timescales. We also found that engaging making with community opened up new and different opportunities to co-make, as the youth drew on, and expanded their social networks. We discuss how these findings impact understanding of how a more equitable making culture can evolve, and its implications for how youth imagine their social futures in and through making.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:20Z (GMT).

This study investigates the potential for modern board games to foster SEL competencies through Cooperative Learning Theory. Because cooperative modern board games combine motivating gameplay and designs that align with elements from Cooperative Learning Theory, they may enhance cooperative attitudes and perspective taking skills.  In this pre-test/post-test quasi-experiment, middle school students played either a cooperative or competitive board game.  Students who played and highly enjoyed the cooperative game showed significantly greater increases in perspective taking skills after gameplay (F=11.42, p=.001), suggesting that playing enjoyable cooperative modern board games may be associated with increased perspective taking skills.  Our findings suggest the need for further investigation into board games as a low-cost platform for students to practice SEL skills outside of the formal classroom environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:20Z (GMT).

We tested how students learn ST skills through designing and playing digital and board games. We looked for students to identify components of a system, describe interconnections, and explain how those interconnections affect the outcomes of the overall system. We discuss changes to our designs and conjectures over two large design cycles.

While the importance of collaboration is often identified as crucial to successful project-based learning activities, there is not much empirical work that describes: a) what these collaborations look like and b) what happens for learners as they engage in collaborative activities. Here, we draw on data from three different studies of maker-based activities to explore the following question: What forms of collaboration are made possible in maker activities? In asking how collaboration develops through making we shift from collaboration as a design feature of learning environments to both a process and an outcome of learning. We take up an emergent perspective on collaboration focusing on the collaborative interactions that occur naturalistically in maker activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:21Z (GMT).

Prior research has shown these skills to be relevant for STEAM achievement, but they have been underemphasized in our schools and in the literature on learning through making. Informed by a distributed cognition perspective and using a combination of qualitative categorical coding and interaction analysis, this study provides a learning sciences approach to studying spatial thinking and learning.  Analyses show that during making activities students engaged in frequent and diverse spatial thinking with a variety of social and material resources and that the sociomaterial contexts of different making activities facilitated different types of spatial thinking. They also show that spatial thinking developed over time and led to problem-solving insights.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Following a theoretical perspective that science emerges as it is practiced, we analyzed video of astronomy programs for 3-to 5-year-old children in a museum setting. Findings suggest that explanations co-constructed by children ranged in sophistication. Children's use of modeling practices supported their development of evidence-based explanations. We also found that children often used gestures to develop and communicate their explanations. Our findings demonstrate the initial ways young children's co-constructed, evidence-based explanations emerge through interactions with educators, peers, and their physical environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:22Z (GMT).

A total of 129 South Korean students who enrolled in economic instruction were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: IF-LA, IT-LA, IF-MA and IT-MA. The results revealed that there was an interaction effect of the focus and level of assistance of SE prompts on delayed conceptual knowledge. Prompts that focused on inference followed by integration resulted in significantly higher immediate conceptual knowledge test scores than prompts that focused only on inference. These findings indicated that SE prompt must be designed considering these two factors according to target knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:23Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Extant research on the efficacy of drawing for promoting learning from dynamic visualizations is contradictory. The discrepancy in these findings has been attributed to the differences between drawing and dynamic visualizations. While dynamic visualizations emphasize spatiotemporal transformations, drawing emphasizes static spatiotemporal structures. Thus, drawing may impede learning from a dynamic visualization when the target learning objective relates to dynamism as it may bias the learner to focus on structure at the expense of transformation. Here, we present our developing findings that drawing provides an effective learning scaffold for learning from dynamic visualizations more so than self-explanation prompts, and that drawing biases learners to attend to fewer spatiotemporal structures.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:23Z (GMT).

We use Conceptual Blending theory to investigate how students attribute emergent meaning to the signs and how they articulate different signs in their algebraic symbolization. The data for this research is drawn from oral exams of students enrolled in upper-division physics. The results shed light on students’ understanding of algebraic symbols and their competence in formulating and manipulating them.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:25Z (GMT).

Through participation in an after-school program and/or summer internship, high school students used Arduino-compatible hardware and software to develop their own scientific instruments for use in classroom physics laboratories. Here we present findings on students’ roles as co-designers and how that influenced their learning and engagement. Furthermore, we discuss issues of accessibility in designing activities in terms of physical and computational affordances. Regardless of prior experience, students were more engaged using pre-assembled robots with defined projects compared with materials and methods traditionally utilized in makerspaces. Additionally, the graphical programming language associated with these robots was more accessible than script-based languages generally used to program Arduinos. This suggests, that to provide equitable access to -- and engagement with -- electronic making, more material and computational scaffolding are required than what is generally provided in conventional makerspaces for implementation in high school classes.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:26Z (GMT).

Thirty-six students from Grade 7 were asked to evaluate the evidence from an investigation involving force and motion. They were shown three inappropriate responses to reasoning about that evidence. They were then asked to evaluate these responses against an informational text that conveyed the scientific explanation with Galileo’s thought experiment. Participants’ verbal responses to reasoning about the inappropriate responses to the informational text were transcribed and analysed qualitatively. We found three factors that influenced strategy development: the students 1) kept the conflict between the competing claims of the domain unresolved, 2) doubted the validity of the inference from the thought experiment and 3) mistakenly assessed the plausibility of the competing claims. Implications for explaining the development of reasoning about scientific evidence and for instruction are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, there are limited studies addressing how to support online groups from the perspectives of motivation and team leadership. This study attempts to understand how achievement goals and leadership styles could influence collaboration experience and individual performance. The results showed that learners who adopted mastery goals tended to engage in group learning through promoting member relationships and group cohesion whereas leaders who adopted performance goals tended to concentrate on helping group complete tasks. High level of relationship-orientated leadership made performance-approach goal orientation a significant predictor of collaboration experience and reduced the negative effect of performance-avoidance goals on final grade. This study finally provides insights to online group activity design.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This however may only be applicable to those learning the materials in their native language as little research has been conducted with the non-native speakers. To address this issue, we investigated the reading of a multi-representational English text with 32 second language English speakers and its relationship with second language proficiency and learning outcomes. Using eye-tracking, we found that readers could be divided into two groups based on the extent they integrated texts and pictures. The difference in the amount of integration in the two groups could not be explained by English proficiency nor by prior knowledge. The groups also performed differently in the post-test with high integrators performing better, hence demonstrating that text-picture integration is equally important when reading multi-representational texts in the second language.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:27Z (GMT).

Looking to unpack perceptions of failure across contexts and potential differences between self-identified sexes, youth who participated in making activities were interviewed about their experiences with failure and thoughts about the term. Youth’s perceptions of failure fell into four categories: failure as enhancing, failure as debilitating, failure as mosaic, and failure as fluid. For the majority of youth (70%), their perception of failure transcended situational boundaries and was not entirely negative as previous research suggested.

National level policies like the Next Generation Science Standards and local instructional polices such as the use of Project-Based Learning require sensemaking by teachers, an inherently social process. As teachers engage with learning events and new tools they will use their network of communities of practice to make sense of these policies, creating assemblages as they play with the policy. In this data from an ethnographic study of school policy, four science teachers engage with tensions created as they make sense of school-based policies and optional national standards. Teachers with larger communities of practice engaged in more productive play with policies. We call for expanding teachers’ networks of communities of practice and bringing policy makers and administrators into the design of learning events and tools for better implementation.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:28Z (GMT).

The empirical basis is a genetics project involving secondary school students and their teacher. A combination of quantitative methods, in the form of frequency counts of structural features of whole-class conversations, and detailed microanalyses of student–teacher interactions are employed. Findings are that, when the teacher orchestrates whole-class dialogues in which students are positioned as active partners in the conversations, more references to everyday experiences are made. In addition, the analysis shows that the mobilisation of everyday experiences enables the students to reason about complex issues related to genetics as well as enables the teacher to display this complexity and coexisting perspectives. The findings are discussed according to possible implications for instruction and dialogic whole-class activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:29Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

New technologies, such as simulated authentic science inquiry, may allow for better assessment of epistemology. Science Classroom Inquiry (SCI) simulations offer real-time, scalable assessment of student practices in authentic science inquiry and by extension their epistemological beliefs about science. Our previous work demonstrated that undergraduate student practices exist on a continuum of sophistication, which may be explained by differences in epistemological beliefs or affective factors like self-efficacy, metacognition, or identity. Our current study examines the relationship between affective factors and inquiry practices. Preliminary analysis suggests that students with expert-like investigations are more likely to identify as a science person. This study raises provocative questions about the intersection between inquiry practices, epistemological beliefs, and affective factors and highlights the potential of simulation-based assessment to examine abstract constructs such as epistemology.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:29Z (GMT).

They support the idea that the flow experience should be considered as a means to improve the quality of computer-supported collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:30Z (GMT).

The program was supported by classroom video and technology to notice and respond to students' thinking. Two cohorts of teachers used software and paper-based supports to plan, capture and study video of their own classrooms, and to develop and share video cases. The research explored what teachers notice about their students' thinking during independent study and collegial study of classroom video. This paper highlights a case study of one teacher's PL. Video cases, transcripts of independent study, collegial study meetings and of an exit interview were analyzed. Doing the independent study first, the teacher identified problematic student thinking to discuss with colleagues. Collegial discussion subsequently clarified students' thinking and explored next steps in teaching. Affordances of independent and collegial learning contexts, and the role of video, technology, and related supports in fostering teachers' PL are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:30Z (GMT).

Our work presents one such effort, focused on teachers as a community of learners. Using a design-based approach, we developed a web-based tool, iPlan, which provides online access to educative curriculum materials in an interactive learning platform. The purpose of this study is to examine design features of iPlan in terms of affordances and challenges. We examine an implementation in an integrated math-science curriculum unit. Through qualitative analysis of interviews with 13 high-school biology teachers across two cycles of design and testing, we identified the ways in which teachers used and learned from the iPlan tool; which features seem to work and why. The study provides implications for developing online learning environments for teachers.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:31Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Fifty first-year university students participated in the project, using Knowledge Forum (KF) as a digital portfolio to collaboratively reflect on face-to-face activities. Metacognitive prompts were provided through KF’s scaffold function to facilitate reflection, especially on socio-emotional aspects. Our analyses revealed that not all students fully regulated socio-emotional challenges encountered through experiencing collaboration in the environment. Moreover, in the case studies, we found that students who attempted to maintain idea diversity to rise above the ideas of individual group members tended to resolve socio-emotional challenges, while others tried to proceed with tasks through avoiding both consolidating ideas and regulating socio-emotional challenges. These findings imply that in addition to socio-emotional supports, epistemic supports are necessary to facilitate socio-emotional regulation.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:31Z (GMT).

In this study, we explored elementary teachers’ participation with a curricular mini-unit in science that invited them to choose among possible next steps, selecting experiments that would responsively build on student thinking. We coded 41 written segments of teachers’ reasoning about their selected next steps to document varied resources that teachers used in making curricular choices. In the vast majority of segments, we found that teachers drew on student ideas and interests as resources for determining next steps. We also identified four clusters of resources that represent different ways of interacting with students’ contributions, with implications for responsiveness, learning, and equity.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:32Z (GMT).

I describe a specific tactic for teaching mathematics: to avoid using the word “thinking.” This approach is informed by scholarship on race, critical mathematics, and embodied cognition. I argue that using the term “thinking” is not necessary for facilitating authentic learning experiences. Moreover, this tactic disrupts a number of pernicious historical narratives (i.e., stereotypes) about mathematics education and about who can and who cannot do mathematics. The crux of the paper is that avoiding the word “thinking”—and other terms associated with “smartness”—loosens the grip Cartesian epistemology has on mathematics education by shifting classroom discourse away from math-as-thinking to math-as-action, which may, in turn, create stronger opportunities for learning. From a learning-sciences perspective, I present other hypotheses stemming out of this pedagogical approach that warrant further research.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:32Z (GMT).

During the 2015-2016 school year, a group of teachers and researchers collaboratively designed and piloted four English language arts (ELA) project-based learning (PBL) curricular units. Teachers and researchers split into four teams, one of which was tasked with designing a project that examined relationships between humans and technology. Throughout this team's design process, co-designers encountered moments of tension that led to increased productivity; however, these tensions also pointed to the ways that participants struggled to navigate multiple roles and goals in agentic ways. This study uses Wertsch's (1991) notion of mediated action to examine the ways that designed curricular objects mediate co-designers' multiple roles (Penuel et al., 2015) and connected goals.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:33Z (GMT).

Specifically, our research goal is to develop the Quality Reference Framework (QRF) with quality indicators and tools in close collaboration with all interested stakeholders worldwide. Based on a rigorous literature review and analysis of existing quality approaches and quality indicators for MOOCs, the Global MOOC Quality Survey was designed and targeted at three core interest groups: MOOC learners, MOOC designers and MOOC facilitators. A total of n=267 took part in the survey. The survey results were complemented with 45 semi-structured interviews with MOOC designers, facilitators and providers. This is to provide a more coherent picture of the issue on quality of MOOCs by investigating the issue of MOOC quality from diverse and different perspectives. This paper presents first results from the survey and semi-structured interviews, the first QRF draft and the feedback gained from workshops at international conferences.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:33Z (GMT).

In the first iteration of a three-year design based research study, students in four grade 5 classroom knowledge building communities studied human body systems. We collected data on 93 students from peer-interviews dealing with the challenges and approaches that they employed during their inquiry process. Using an inductive approach that examined students’ reactions, we identified 247 relevant utterances which we organized and coded. Our first key finding indicates the inter-relation between students’ attitudes, beliefs, understandings, and feelings related to their mindsets. Our second key finding shows that students rely on different strategies of an inquiry cycle when they face challenges and setbacks. These results set the stage for further inquiry and design modifications.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:33Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This paper investigated to what extent such problems are caused by inadequate evidence-based reasoning scripts that guide teachers in the way they tackle pedagogical problems. We investigated the scripts of N = 103 beginning and N = 236 advanced pre-service teachers by asking them to analyze fictitious, but realistic problem cases in an open-answer format. Afterwards, they were asked to describe the cognitive activities they engaged in during problem analysis. Results showed that advanced students more often than beginners reported to engage in problem identification, while beginners more often reported to engage in goal-setting. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards research on learning and instruction positively predicted their engagement in these cognitive activities. Thus, it appears that the evidence-based reasoning scripts of both beginning and advanced pre-service teachers might benefit from scaffolding, as well as supportive motivational-affective factors.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:34Z (GMT).

A possible solution is to offer MOOC participants the opportunity to engage in collaborative activities. However, small-group collaboration in MOOCS poses several challenges which may reduce the beneficial effects of collaboration and reduce participants’ satisfaction with both the collaboration process and the course. In this work-in-progress paper, we describe the development of a library of typical problems that may occur during online collaboration in asynchronous, text-based online settings. The library covers the following aspects of collaboration: communication, joint information processing, coordination, and reciprocal interaction. The library was generated in a process by combining a top-down literature search and a bottom-up identification of typical problems in existing collaboration data. The library will be used as a basis for developing intelligent support for student collaboration in online courses.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

To evaluate nursing students learning with the proposed agent-based environment, we conducted a quasi-experimental study. The results revealed that nursing students who learned with the agent-based environment gained significantly higher conceptual knowledge within the key concepts of pharmacology comparing to students who learned via lecture-based curriculum. These findings suggest an advantage with implementing explanatory agent-based models that point out the essential mechanisms underlying pharmacological phenomena in nursing education.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:36Z (GMT).

However, definitions of authentic learning and explanations of its effectiveness are diverse. Therefore, Betz, Flake, Mierwald, and Vanderbeke (2016) developed a theoretical model that captures various aspects of this heterogeneous construct. Our goal in this paper is to undertake first steps towards an empirical investigation of this model based on data from two pilot studies that were conducted in an OSL. In both studies, we investigated whether the intended authenticity level of the method that students used to solve a given task had an impact on students’ perceived authenticity and situational interest. Our studies show mixed findings that are contrary to the assumptions underlying the model of Betz et al. (2016). Hence, suggestions for an advancement of that model as well as implications for future research on authentic learning are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:37Z (GMT).

The evidence for the effectiveness of comparisons has primarily come from laboratory experiments on analogy and analogy-based interventions in math classrooms rather than investigations of naturalistic math classrooms. As a result, the qualitative aspects of comparisons that may be important for the effectiveness of comparisons have been understudied. This paper describes preliminary research on qualitative dimensions of comparisons. Analysis of video-recordings of a math classroom resulted in identification of 244 naturally occurring comparisons that were coded along five dimensions. Two dimensions related to the ambiguity of comparisons and a system for representing such ambiguity are extensively discussed herein. Potential effects of ambiguity of comparisons on learning are outlined.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

One way to provide support is for instructors to monitor students’ understanding of course challenges and content in discussion boards. Using SNA, we explored how two instructors participated in students’ discussions in CBL and traditional online courses to see how instructors adapted support with CBL courses. Instead of differences across pedagogies, we found differences across instructors: one instructor contributed on the periphery of students’ discussions, while another instructor directly contributed to students’ discussions. Based on sociograms and instructors’ feedback, we found that the instructors took different approaches to providing formative feedback (e.g., private communication versus public discussion) intended to scaffold students’ knowledge construction.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:37Z (GMT).

Third graders experienced one of four sequences: Algebra-Arithmetic, Algebra-Area, Arithmetic-Algebra, and Area-Algebra. All sequences produced improvements in solving practiced 2D × 2D problems. Critically, the Area-Algebra and Arithmetic-Algebra sequences had the largest learning effects, with the former better for participants with some prior knowledge of 2D × 2D multiplication and the latter better for participants with no prior knowledge. All sequences also produced improvements on unpracticed transfer problems, with the Area-Algebra sequence producing the largest learning effects. Finally, improvements were most associated with prior knowledge of single-digit addition and subtraction – but not multiplication – facts. The implications of these results are discussed and future directions outlined.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:38Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

While several types of IP systems have become available, none offer tracking of multiple agents that balances high accuracy with low cost. This paper highlights new 3D IP technology designed for educational contexts, which coordinates as few as 4 and as many as 80 physical “tags.” The tags act both as anchors to delineate the play space and as trackers that send high-accuracy location data to a server in real time that can later be played back. To test the impact of the technology on learning, we compared it to a parallel non-IP environment that approximates locations between two points in classroom settings. Findings indicate that the IP technology enhances engagement with systems thinking concepts through more robust reflection on movements and actions compared to the non-IP environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:38Z (GMT).

An empirical study was conducted to compare students in these two groups in terms of reasoning strategies on assessments of declarative and explanatory knowledge as well as solving transfer problems. The findings suggest that the ABM students' reasoning strategies on the explanatory knowledge tasks and problem-solving activities seemed to have been influenced by the previous computationally embodied learning experience. Nevertheless, the dynamic visualization students seemed to rely on memory retrieval of information from the videos.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:39Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We asked: (1) What did third-graders' digital artifacts reveal about their use of multiple modes to communicate information? (2) How did students describe their modal use as they shared their digital artifacts? Findings suggest that third-graders were strategic and flexible in their modal selection and use. In sharing presentations, there was variability in students' descriptions of multimodal features and rationale for modal use.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:40Z (GMT).

Grounded in a sociocultural perspective of learning and analytically guided by methods of multimodal and interaction analysis, guiding intent participation is a distinct category of guided participation (Kirshner, 2008; Rogoff, 1995). Guiding intent participation takes as relevant both the coordinated efforts of oldtimers and relative newcomers to make contributions to ongoing work and learning, as well as the observational activities by the oldtimers that are precursors to guidance. The analytic implications of the concept in support of rethinking assessment to consider social context are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:41Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Phenomenography is known as a useful strategy to investigate variations in conceptual understandings of different phenomena. The paper aims to: (1) examine the research papers in educational technology studies over the past 15 years (2003-2017), and (2) evaluate the feasibility of phenomenography in the field of educational technology studies. A systematic review is done to the educational technology research papers that involve the use of phenomenography. A systematic literature search in the 14 SSCI journal websites produced 35 articles. Although there were only few papers which used phenomenography as research approach in educational technology studies, there was a gradual rise in the number of studies using phenomenography across years, with more focus on studying students’ learning experiences, especially in the higher education sector. Implications about the use of phenomenography in educational technology field will be discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:41Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We conducted focus group workshops with kindergarten and first grade teachers in the UK and found that, while teachers recognized potential benefits of child-led approaches in science education, they also expressed challenges that were novel in the literature on teacher views. In particular, teachers had a more detailed consideration of EF skill development, and reflected on the consequences to children’s learning of how much instructional guidance they provided.  Moreover, we found differences in challenges reported by kindergarten and first grade teachers. Future research is needed with teachers of low-income children and a broader range of education stakeholders, in programs that produce a measurable change in teachers’ and children’s learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:42Z (GMT).

We share key learnings gleaned around critical notions of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) after participating in a conference that explored marginalized groups and ideas in STEM education. Key ideas we distilled for further deliberation include: 1) How is STEM identified and who is part of it?; 2) Why is critical discourse essential in STEM? and; 3) How do we attend to affect and aesthetic experience in STEM? We argue considering such issues and fostering epistemic fluency will allow STEM to grow and diversify. In presenting our understandings of STEM as it exists, and where we feel it is moving, our learning provokes dialogue about how critical research can impact STEM and educational research.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:42Z (GMT).

Based on previous research, this association between quantitative analysis and learning analytics does seem to be the trend. However, certain researchers have proposed the use of multimodal learning analytic techniques as a viable and valuable contribution to more qualitative research methodologies. This paper examines that idea by trying to use the output from an algorithm that learns discriminating features, as the starting point for video observations.  Ultimately, the analysis suggests that there is utility in leaning on machine learning to help identify important patterns in the data, provided that those patterns are contextualized and studied using the original video data. Additionally, the work makes clear the need for better tools for conducting these types of multimodal analyses.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The students participated in three small group sessions with several predict-test-explain-tasks. The use of scientific concepts and their relations were analysed from session transcripts using content analysis and categories of explanatory power were formed. Then, the changes in explanatory power during DC-tasks were analysed and three categories of conceptual patterns were formed. In first category, no conceptual development occurred, students used simple explanations and were not able to apply relational knowledge. In second category, conceptual development occurred: students explanations became more scientific and their explanatory power increased. In third category, the students have learned to use relational knowledge and the conceptual pattern shows flexibility in providing explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:43Z (GMT).

A positive relation between children’s orthographic awareness and character recognition has been widely acknowledged. Collaboration is a commonly used game design element and a frequently targeted game design element regarding 21st century skill development. Nevertheless, little is known regarding how games should be designed for collaborative Chinese character or vocabulary learning, and how game design may influence student collaborative learning skill development. The results of a quasi-experiment in a primary school indicate that the designed ARC (augmented reality-based Chinese character composition game) is an effective system for improving students’ Chinese character learning performance and collaborative learning quality. The findings provide insights into game-based learning design for young learners and language learners.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:45Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

By activating prior knowledge and raising awareness of knowledge gaps, the PF problem-solving phase is assumed to help students acquire conceptual knowledge. However, it is still unclear which specific problem-solving processes prepare learning from the subsequent instruction. To explore the role of problem-solving behaviours during the initial phase of PF, the process data of 24 participants of a quasi-experimental study were analysed. We hypothesised that evaluating their own problem-solving during the initial phase of PF facilitates students’ awareness of their knowledge gaps and, thus, is associated with learning from the subsequent instruction. However, our data analyses did not support this hypothesis. Further explorations showed the importance of students achieving some understanding of the goal state of the problem they solve in the initial phase of PF.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:45Z (GMT).

Specifically, the study examined how reflective activities contribute to growth in understanding and caring about epistemic ideals and processes. The context of the study was an online course on digital information literacy. Teacher participants engaged in two types of reflective activities designed to promote epistemic growth: reflective experience tasks and reflective journals. Analysis of the journals revealed that participants experienced growth in understanding of epistemic ideals and processes, in pedagogical knowledge about teaching epistemic ideals and processes, and in appreciation of the importance and value of using and teaching epistemic ideals and processes. Participants described the course readings and the reflective experience tasks as the main contributors to growth. These activities jointly enabled them to significantly expand their understandings of epistemic ideals and processes in ways that were personally and professionally meaningful.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:45Z (GMT).

We observed the knowledge building process of a Grade 5 classroom that studied ecology, conducted in-depth semi-structured interview with nine students to gather detailed accounts of their personal experiences with science inquiry organized based on Knowledge Building pedagogy.  Qualitative analysis of the interviews in relation to the classroom observations elaborates how the students experienced changes in their learning and their socio-emotional and cognitive responses to these changes. The findings show that the students addressed the challenges brought by the changes by exerting a series of cognitive efforts themselves and by gaining support from their knowledge building community.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:46Z (GMT).

However, because models are abstractions of real world phenomena, making connections beyond them may not be straightforward. In this paper, we argue that expansive curricular framing can support productive epistemological framing of modeling, and influence how learners see their model exploration as relevant to their ongoing investigations. We present an analysis of two groups of undergraduate students investigating relative fitness of low and high mutating bacterial strains in a computational model. We demonstrate that even though the groups are comparable in the quality of work within the model, expansive curricular framing impacts students’ epistemological framing of the activity and whether students see ideas from the model as relevant in a broader scope of their investigations.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:46Z (GMT).

The paper examines mechanisms through which white researchers, working with a racially diverse team on professional development (PD) for mathematics teachers, instantiated an institutional space of whiteness despite the expressed goal of all of the researchers and designers of the PD to interrupt sociopolitical injustice in mathematics education. The analysis uses empirical examples from a particular conversation about the PD design process that we argue discursively maintains whiteness as the overarching frame of the joint activity.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:47Z (GMT).

The university researchers and the classroom teachers were active participants who assisted the students; shared their own learning lives; and provided resources, tools, and opportunities that helped shape the students’ inquiry projects. The analysis features a co-navigation (with the researchers, the teachers, and the students) of learning trajectories across multiple contexts and social interactions. Findings reveal the agentive ways students took up and cast aside opportunities and artifacts in unexpected, yet fruitful, ways for the development of their inquiry projects.

Using these methods to analyze two different groups we found the groups to be very similar. However, our sense was that the groups were not similar in regard to equity. We then used an adapted version of Duek’s (2000) group processing behaviors to code and analyze the two groups. This method indicated that one group engaged in far more equity-promoting behaviors than the other, suggesting a difference in the relative equity between them.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:48Z (GMT).

Engaging teachers in a co-design process to create micro-credentials for professional development activities provides quality requirements and options that are valuable for improving teacher’s knowledge and skills, and impacting classroom practice, providing an opportunity to bridge the gap between research and practice. Through a research practice partnership between a suburban school district and a local university and using design-based implementation research, a co-design process for developing multiple micro-credentials was successfully implemented. Teachers with little to no previous experience with micro-credentials are capable of designing rigorous and relevant required tasks for professional development that targets improvements to classroom practices for improvements to student achievement.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:49Z (GMT).

Two researchers collaborated with a group of high school students with a shared goal of designing school technology practices that were meaningful to the students. Informed by theories of infrastructuring in participatory design (Le Dantec & DiSalvo, 2013), the collaboration explicitly sought to re-mediate the social relations in the design of school technology practices. Four themes emerged in relation to the ways students sought to construct and refine the design space: Relevance to Student Interests; Opportunities for Responsibility and Growth; Expansion and Refinement of Activity; and Ensuring Use. Implications of the findings are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These erroneous solution attempts can form the basis for acquiring valid target concepts during subsequent instruction. Literature on conceptual change as well as studies on ‘productive failure’ indicate that elaborating on typical errors and comparing these erroneous solution attempts to correct solutions may be crucial for learning in these settings. We compared three conditions in an experimental study: Students of all conditions first engaged in an identical problem-solving activity. Afterwards students worked on elaboration tasks that introduced correct solutions. In this so-called instruction phase, students worked with 1) only correct solutions, 2) correct and typical erroneous solution attempts, 3) correct and typical erroneous solution attempts with prompts to compare these attempts. Posttest results indicate that only students who were prompted to compare the solution attempts significantly benefited from learning with erroneous solution attempts.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:50Z (GMT).

To explore new ways to engage youth and complement math learning in the classroom, researchers and middle school teachers collaborated to implement a year-long PBL course, “Design Math.” This course supported math learning through design and textile-based crafting projects by leveraging embodiment and tangible manipulatives. Students built life-size and scale-model yurts (i.e., tents) while adhering to a set of design constraints. Preliminary findings suggest that project-based approaches in math learning have the potential to promote and sustain student engagement, broaden participation in mathematical thinking, and afford deeper conceptual understanding of the mathematical concepts of measurement and geometry.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:50Z (GMT).

It included students engaging in online discussion to help them reflect on their school experience and to collaborate with their peers in linking theory and practice. Through an analysis of their online discourses, we identified a range of conceptual and collaborative strategies that the participants used to deepen their understanding and extend their learning space. We also examined the students’ discourse through the lens of theory-practice dialectics to show how pre-service teachers practicalize theories and theorize practical experience. We also discussed the implications of designing online discussion and the use of strategies to scaffold pre-service teacher learning in theory-practice integration.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:51Z (GMT).

This study examines how prioritizing the agency of primary school teachers, engaged with researchers in the collaborative design of curriculum innovations, may allow for teachers to develop and productively leverage expertise. Using data from teacher surveys, interviews, and artifacts, our analysis has centered on what expertise teachers may develop around project-based learning and national science education reforms and what agency teachers have to influence the design of curriculum. We found evidence (1) teachers increased their understanding of project-based learning but showed fewer gains in understanding key ideas in science education reforms and (2) teachers significantly influenced the design of curriculum innovations. This study has implications for teacher learning and the design of curriculum innovations aligned to research-based design principles and national education reforms.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:51Z (GMT).

Wearable cameras and real-time video feed-back have changed the research terrain. And yet scholars often use such data without examining the ways that video – as digital technology - structures and shapes the research findings, while enabling new insights into the event-nature of learning. This international symposium addresses this topic by (1) showcasing and analyzing innovative uses of video technologies in the study of learning, and (2) historically situating such video experiments within traditions of scientific cinema. The term ‘scientific cinema’ is used in media studies to describe all uses of the moving image in scientific study, beginning with the pioneering work of the Lumiére brothers in the 1890s. This symposium presents four contemporary case studies in which video is used innovatively to investigate mathematics learning experiences in three different countries (US, UK, Italy).","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:53Z (GMT).

Since its launch, FUSE has been adapted successfully in 136 different school-based implementations operating across 18 different states and two countries (USA and Finland). Yet, despite being tailored to each context by local actors, FUSE has largely managed to preserve the integrity of implementation as educational innovation. Each contribution explores a point in the lifecycle of a FUSE adoption and describes local adaptations of the approach in the US and in Finland. In addition to addressing the critical question of how new educational innovations are adopted and sustained, this symposium provides perspectives on how to balance adaptability to local contexts and the integrity (rather than fidelity) of implementation.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:53Z (GMT).

However, its application has largely been limited to knowledge in a narrow selection of STEM domains, limiting the generalizability of its findings. This symposium draws together scholarship operating within the Knowledge Analysis tradition to investigate reasoning and learning in domains outside of STEM classroom subjects. In doing so, each paper explores the affordances and limitations of Knowledge Analysis to shed light on significant questions in their respective domains of knowledge, including: restorative justice practices, the ethics of drone warfare, undergraduate course design, and urban planning. By further expanding the use of Knowledge Analysis to include non-STEM subjects, we hope to raise important questions and offer richer and more generalizable views of knowledge and learning relevant to both STEM and non-STEM domains.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:54Z (GMT).

Student groups were videotaped participating in high school biology units that were scaffolded in inquiry-based experimentation and argumentation with complex systems computer simulations. Interactions around the argumentation prompts revealed extraneous/non-reflective and generative/reflective strategies for collective evidence use. We hypothesize that access to recorded archived data along with access to dynamic just-in-time simulations promoted more generative/reflective strategies. Preliminary data on students' written responses reveal stronger written argumentation responses when students engaged in generative/reflective strategies compared to when students used extraneous/non-reflective strategies. Where extraneous/non-reflective strategies occur, we suggest that teachers be made aware of the tendency toward this kind of group decision making and that greater emphasis be placed on optimal evidence use through active modeling.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:55Z (GMT).

Orchestration tools are based on the idea of capturing, analyzing, and visualizing student activities during class time and feeding them back to teachers to facilitate real time monitoring and support of students. With examples from the contexts of individual and collaborative learning, the symposium addresses two questions, namely what information about student activities teachers need, and how teachers use orchestration tools in their classrooms. Two papers focus on the first question, and furthermore investigate how teachers respond to initial versions of orchestration tools. The remaining two papers focus on how teachers actually use orchestration tools in their classrooms. The symposium as such offers examples of state of the art research and ample opportunity for discussing future directions in the field of teacher orchestration tools.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:55Z (GMT).

However, few studies have aimed at reporting on the designs and enactments of intentional structures for building teachers' social capital through the development of social networks. Even fewer have discussed the deliberate mechanisms and methodologies used in the interventions. In this structured poster symposium, we present six current efforts in building teachers' social capital with an emphasis on what this work is and how it is done.

But whereas design researchers have been developing domain-specific theories that implicate the role of physical movement in conceptual learning, the field has yet to agree on a conceptually coherent and empirically validated framework for leveraging and shaping students’ capacity for physical movement as a socio–cognitive educational resource. This symposium thus convenes to ask, “What is movement in relation to concepts such that we can design for learning?” To stimulate discussion, we highlight an emerging tension across a set of innovative technological designs with respect to the framing question of whether students should discover an activity’s targeted movement forms themselves or that these forms should be cued directly. Our content domains span mathematics (proportions, geometry), physics, chemistry, and ecological system dynamics (predator–prey, bees).","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:56Z (GMT).

In this symposium, presenters draw from scholarship in science studies and the philosophy of science, cognitive work on epistemic reasoning, and research in science education to unpack dimensions of evidentiary reasoning. Our collective focus is on identifying aspects of evidentiary knowledge and reasoning that prevail in scientific practice but are typically absent from classroom implementations of inquiry in science education. Further, the symposium will address sources of challenge for teachers and students as they engage with evidence in the science classroom and discuss ways in which educators can scaffold the development of more sophisticated reasoning with and about evidence.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:57Z (GMT).

It is therefore essential these are of the highest quality to help learners. Ideally, online educational resources would constantly improve based on data and input from each learner, giving a better outcome for the next. This symposium explores issues around the use of crowdsourcing to harness learners’ interactions with resources like online problems and videos in order to improve these resources for the next learner. We hope to explore the benefits and limitations of thinking about learners through the lens of crowdsourcing, to imagine learnersourcing. We will discuss four ways in which researchers have leveraged crowdsourcing to help students learn in a variety of educational contexts, and in doing so we will also discuss ways in which educational theory can guide the future of learnersourcing.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:39:58Z (GMT).

Is a disciplinary focus a good model for preparing learners for these roles? How well does a disciplinary apprenticeship prepare learners for their everyday lives? This symposium includes theoretical, methodological and design presentations that set the stage for engaging the audience in a conversation over a number of overarching questions that include: What motivates broadening our gaze beyond the disciplines?

This symposium assembles four papers that offer various ways regarding the measurement of prerequisites and processes of such regulatory efforts during group learning. The presented methods range from Likert-scale self-report questionnaires over video case vignettes towards an analysis of real group processes by aid of logfiles and discourse coding schemes. These methods will be critically discussed, especially in terms of their transferability to studying collaborative learning in diverse educational contexts, both formal and informal. That way, the symposium will significantly expand previous methods for the assessment of self-, co- and shared regulation during collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:00Z (GMT).

In this study, we investigate how teachers open up aspects of their curricular activities and invite students to partner in the epistemic decisions that drive classroom activity. We draw on work in 3 classrooms as instrumental cases to illustrate what teachers did to ‘open up’ the curriculum and how these moves re-distributed epistemic agency. In each of the three cases, what teachers opened up had different implications in terms of their reach: the resulting “ripple effect” of the impact of the decisions that students were involved making. These cases illustrate the “disciplined improvisational” work (Sawyer, 2004) required to open up space within the constraints and boundaries of the curriculum to create opportunities for re-distributing epistemic agency.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:00Z (GMT).

This can pose significant challenges for researchers, teachers, and policy makers trying to decide which assessment methods are appropriate for their specific CT interventions. Rather than trying to create a single unified definition of CT, this symposium brings together a broad spectrum of leading CT researchers to share what CT means for them, how it influenced their learning designs, and the methods for assessing CT learning. This interactive session will showcase these different views of CT in a single place and serve as a rich opportunity for comparison and discussion.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:01Z (GMT).

A recent special issue of the Journal of the Learning Sciences was dedicated to exploring “CHAT/DBR” from multiple perspectives (Penuel, Cole & O’Neill, 2016). Beyond the similarities and differences between these methodologies, this scholarship also imagines new possibilities and orientations drawing on the two traditions – new roles for researchers and collaborators, alternative “argumentative grammars” (Kelly, 2004) underlying these approaches, and even new conceptions of learning itself. This symposium highlights the work of emerging scholars whose research employs variations of CHAT-inspired DBR in collaborative, community-grounded work oriented toward social change. The session offers innovative perspectives on how we conceptualize learning; rethinking design in our methods; what constitutes a learning environment; and rethinking relationships among researchers, partners, learners and interventions.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:02Z (GMT).

We heed Dewey’s admonition to look beyond sugar-coating: we do not seek to claim that “play is a good method for supporting traditional mathematics learning,” but rather, to explore the ways that mathematics is engaged through play, and how such different engagement with mathematics might transform students’ relationships with the domain. Taken as a collective, the papers in this symposium address this issue by looking across technical and physical contexts, using different lenses on play, and studying different experiences of play. Despite these contrasts, we jointly ask questions about what mathematics thinking and learning could look like if we changed the rules of the game.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:03Z (GMT).

This predicament suggests that learning research would benefit by drawing upon sociological frameworks. Individual students are embedded within peer groups, classrooms are constituted by multiple inter-relationships, and school level learning is shaped by complex interactions amongst adults and children.

Virtual internships are learning environments in which participants can develop complex knowledge that make up the epistemic frame of a profession.  The virtual internship designed for preservice teachers considers the components of TPACK as epistemic frame elements.  As a subsequent step, this study also aims to evaluate preservice teachers’ TPACK development using Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA).  Adapted from social network analysis, ENA is an innovative data analysis method that affords investigation of dynamic interaction among frame elements.  In this study, the “dynamic interplay” among TPACK components will be analyzed using ENA. Thus, this study proposes two novel approaches to the challenge of supporting and evaluating preservice teachers’ TPACK development, which is considered essential to teach effectively with technology.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:06Z (GMT).

One biology teacher and his four classes of 8th graders (N = 100) participated in this study. Students used a digital text tool, VidyaMap, to learn about photosynthesis and energy transformation. Two classes were provided prompts for epistemic reflection. The prompts encouraged students to reflect on the epistemic role of the tool for inquiry. The other two classes served as comparison groups, and used the tool without epistemic reflection prompts. Quantitative analysis showed that the classes that received the epistemic reflection prompts outperformed the comparison classes in their learning. We also coded the levels of students’ epistemic reflection and found that it was correlated with students’ science learning from the tool. Qualitative analyses further suggested how students with high and low epistemic reflection scores differed in their inquiry using the tool. Implications of findings are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:06Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Having no access to the molecular world and lacking the force-based explanation, students view bonds as attached solid spheres for which energy is needed to bring them together, or as coiled springs that release energy when relaxed. Our ELI-Chem learning environment enables sensory-motor experiences of attractive and repulsive forces at four increasing degrees of embodiment, from mouse interaction to haptic feedback. The theoretical framework is based on embodied learning theory by relating conceptual learning to bodily experience. A DBR-mixed methods research was conducted with 48 students using a pretest-intervention-posttest design. Findings show an increase in students' conceptual understanding in all four conditions, with the highest learning gain in the haptic condition. ELI-Chem provided students the vocabulary, concepts and principles that are required to shift from naïve knowledge to a force-based understanding.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:07Z (GMT).

Employing principles of design for embodied learning, this simulation elicits specific hand gestures to encourage students to enact causal mechanisms. In the context of individual interviews, students were prompted to give scientific explanations of what causes seasons before, during, and after use of the simulation. We investigated whether students' explanations would improve after using the simulation and whether students would take up these gestures in their post-simulation explanations. We found strong evidence that students improved their explanations, and although students frequently used gestures in their post-simulation explanations, they infrequently used the specific gestures prompted by the interface, a divergence from a previous study of another topic. We offer possible interpretations for this finding, and we suggest design considerations for gesture-based simulations that encourage productive student reasoning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:09Z (GMT).

Results on visual comfort, flow experience, and learning experience in the VR HMD condition are significantly higher than those in 3D projection and the AR condition. We conclude that VR HMD contributes to better viewing experience and learning experience for hands-on VELE in the scenarios tested.

In this paper we explore the potential for a coupled system that integrates computational and experimental methodologies to support learning to navigate scientific uncertainties. We present a case study of a group of undergraduate students in a ‘hybrid’ computational-experimental biology laboratory course as they investigated a complex biological system. We describe the nature of their progress: (1) mapping their theoretical understanding of the system and (2) planning and implementing their investigation. We then describe the role of the coupled methodologies in supporting their progress by (1) focusing the goals of their investigations, and (2) allowing for comparison and triangulation.

A methodological framework for analyzing maker-centered learning, by relying on ethnographic video data and participant observations, was developed. The study examined the extent to which young students are able to productively participate in creative design and making activities. The results indicated that four of the five student teams successfully engaged in the co-invention processes. The importance of a shared epistemic object of co-design was prominent on every team. Some teams experienced challenges in organizing collaborative processes and the team size appeared to have a significant effect in this regard. The successful teams were able to take on complex and multifaceted epistemic and fabrication-related challenges.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:13Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

During creation processes, controversies between authors emerge that they discuss on the article's talk page. Research suggests that controversies based on opposing points of view and contradictory evidence can be fruitful to trigger individual elaboration processes. However, previous research also showed that many wikis are not necessarily suited to identify relevant discussion contents and thus users need additional support as guidance. In an experimental study (N = 181) on wiki talk pages, we investigated two scaffolding measures in conjunction with the need for cognitive closure: (1) visual markers to highlight controversy status (implicit) and (2) a collaboration script that directs users towards discussions (explicit). The results show that both guidance types in interaction with the need for cognitive closure can affect learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:18Z (GMT).

While experts have body of knowledge and heuristics to arrive at solutions, novices do not have such knowledge and hence find it difficult to design solutions. In order to determine the nature of difficulties faced by novices, we conducted a study where novices were required to come up with a conceptual design for a given software design problem. We used the Function-Structure-Behaviour (FSB) lens to analyze the artefacts and the processes. Results from the analysis show that novices were unsuccessful when they fixate to either one or all FSB elements initially.  These results inform the pedagogical strategies for teaching learning of conceptual design in the context of software.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:21Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

An emotional design that changes learners’ emotional status can facilitate or suppress multimedia learning. In CATLM individual difference is an assumption. How learner expertise affects the effectiveness of emotional designs remains unclear. This study comprising 122 K12 students aims to investigate the effect of learner expertise (novice vs advanced) and emotional design– face-shape like and warm colors–(with vs without) on developing remembering and understanding. These results showed that (1)in remembering the emotional design group performed better, and (2)in understanding the design benefited the advanced group, but not the novice group. A plausible explanation is the benefits of the emotional design do not overweigh its drawback in the novice group when developing understanding. Further analysis reveals that learner expertise and learning outcomes aid to determine the designs’ effects.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:24Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

But visuals can impede learning if students lack representational competencies that enable them to understand what the visuals show. We consider two instructional activities that target two qualitatively different representational competencies: explicit sense-making competencies and implicit perceptual fluency. Prior cross-sectional studies showed that students’ prior knowledge determines in which sequence they should receive sense-activities and perceptual-activities. This raises the question: is there a learning progression for sense-making competencies and perceptual fluency? In this paper, we address this question with a longitudinal experiment in which 71 students worked with sense-activities and perceptual-activities integrated in six instructional units of a chemistry undergraduate course. For each unit, students either received sense-activities or perceptual-activities first. We assessed learning gains of chemistry knowledge after each unit. Results suggest a learning progression that aligns with results of prior cross-sectional studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:25Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Our analysis shows that mentors were offered three kinds of support: community building, logistical, and pedagogical. The following kinds of changes and additions were made to the design: expanded project requirements, improved technical infrastructure, and increased opportunities for interaction in discussion forums and live peer chat sessions.

This involves per-ceptual fluency: the ability to automatically see meaning in visuals. To support perceptual fluency, instructional interventions support inductive learning by providing simple tasks that require quick attention to relevant features. Sociocultural research shows that collaboration affords nonverbal communication behaviors that helps students attend to visual features more quickly, which helps them acquire perceptual fluency. In contrast, cognitive research suggests that collaboration is ineffective for learning from simple tasks. Hence, we ask: Can collaboration via nonverbal communication enhance the acquisition of perceptual fluency? We investigated this question by examining how 10 dyads collaborate on simple perceptual tasks via nonverbal communication. We analyzed gestures and interviews about learning experiences. Further, we compared dyads’ performance on perceptual activities to 28 students who worked on the activities individually. Our findings suggest that collaboration helps students acquire perceptual fluency with visuals.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Tasks that involve reading, interpreting and synthesizing multiple sources have been explored particularly in the epistemic cognition literature. Interdisciplinarity is a growing area of interest in education, with commensurate interest in the learning sciences regarding the means by which we induct students into interdisciplinary ways of thinking and working. While interdisciplinary contexts frequently involve connecting multiple sources, from different disciplines, these text-integration tasks have not been well investigated.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:38Z (GMT).

We analyzed two teachers' discourse as they facilitated students' use of virtual and physical models and compared their students' understanding of and engagement with models during a biology unit. We found that one teacher had significantly more talk than the other about the affordances and constraints of models, and his students more purposefully used the affordances of the models to engage in scientific thinking on their own and seemed to learn more about affordances and constraints of scientific models than students in the other teacher’s class. Our findings suggest that the ways in which teachers talk about the affordances and constraints of scientific models is important for students to understand and utilize them as tools for thinking and building knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:39Z (GMT).

In this intervention, a pedagogical framework and a teamwork competency measure were supported by a techno-pedagogical system. The intervention was carried out over two iterations with the same teacher and class, over two different collaborative inquiry tasks. Student participants (n=39) were in Secondary One when they started. The study employed the design-based research methodology with a convergent parallel mixed methods design. The quantitative results of students’ peer-rated teamwork ratings all increased positively in iteration two while the qualitative analysis of the teamwork reflection text revealed that students had a deeper understanding of their teamwork competency. The converging findings indicate that the intervention has helped students to grow their personal teamwork competency. Implications and future work of the study are highlighted.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:41Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In recent years, science literacy has been conceptualized as the ability to access and make sense of scientific expertise in the time and in the context of need. Recently, evidence has shown that when people attempt to make sense of controversial issues, their processing of scientific information is biased by their existing ideologies and worldviews. This is considered the culprit of persistent controversy about scientific findings, such as the findings that indicate anthropogenic climate change. Here, we propose an implication to this evidence: To promote science literacy, educators should promote an ""epistemic balancing act"" in the science classroom, avoiding both credulity and hyper-skepticism. Implications for educational policy are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These negotiations are supported, or not, by the teacher’s propensity to engage in the knowledge of children and use teaching to construct shared goals for learning. Implications of the work include new ways educators might define LDs as a complex phenomenon that reflects how children’s knowledge of mathematics advances, or not, through a shared cognition grounded in children’s unique knowing and learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:44Z (GMT).

Conversational mismatches, we contend, arise in part from tensions between instructional goals of fostering students’ engagement in authentic scientific sensemaking and guiding them toward particular understandings of pre-determined concepts and models.

Nevertheless, peer feedback may be the main source of formative feedback available in some settings, such as in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). A key part of the problem may be that students do not have sufficient incentive to offer their best feedback in settings where supervision is minimal. In this paper, we investigate whether students provide feedback of higher quality when it is done in a public setting rather than in a private setting. We report on an experimental study with 65 participants randomly assigned to a public feedback and a private feedback condition. We report the effect of the manipulation in terms of the quality of feedback offered as measured by a validated coding scheme, the subjective rating of the feedback, the effect on propensity to revise and success at increasing the quality of the writing. Limitations of the study and implications for practice are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:54Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We identified five component constructs of maker mindsets and developed an instrument that asks participants to respond to vignettes related to each construct. To establish content validity, a group of maker professionals (n=17) completed a card sorting task in which they grouped the 25 vignette-based items based on the maker mindset attribute that they thought each item was intended to measure. Analysis of the results revealed 16 items that were grouped in one of three clusters that largely aligned with the five original constructs after collapsing some constructs. We conclude that the 16 remaining items have content validity.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:40:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We explored this question by designing a computer-based coach for Invention activities – a form of ill-structured problem-solving followed by expository instruction. The Coach was designed to elicit the core learning mechanisms of Invention by problematizing students’ solutions and mimicking naturalistic teacher guidance. This research tests both the efficacy of our designed guidance and the appropriate amount of guidance for Invention activities. In an experimental study, 205 middle schoolers worked with full, minimal, or no guidance versions of the Coach before receiving a lecture on the target knowledge (ratio structures in science). Students who received the full guidance Coach were better able to transfer their knowledge to novel domains. The work has implications for the design of guidance in open-ended learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Five dimensions of knowledge are posited as essential to effective implementation of the NGSS, including assessment design for formative purposes and science literacies inherent in the practices of developing, carrying out and reporting science investigations. Learning along these dimensions is being documented through close analyses of teacher talk in the workshops, design team meetings, at their school sites, in the classroom, and in the assessments they design, implement and revise.

However, teachers still lack the resources and scaffolds to facilitate such integration. In this paper, I present a way for scaffolding design thinking in middle school classrooms by using incomplete models as anchors. Findings show that the use of an incomplete seed model as an anchor evoked different responses from the student designers – some extending it immediately, some returning back to it after exploring other design options, and some likely referring to it implicitly. The incomplete seed model provided an example to the students for practicing design thinking and make tradeoffs. The incompleteness also allowed students to pursue different design trajectories.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:07Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Through task-based studies with first-grade children, we examine the design affordances of a tangible user interface, Project Bloks. For the scope of this paper, we focus on two coding puzzles where children engage with loops. Our findings reveal that the design affordances of the system are conducive to the learning of loops, and highlight some difficulties that children encounter with loops. We discuss the implications of these preliminary results for designers and educators, and propose ideas for future work.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:08Z (GMT).

In particular, it is still unclear what the role of teachers should be during collaborative learning activities and how we can better support and guide teachers in their implementation of collaborative activities. In this study, we investigated how digital learning environments can be leveraged to support collaborative learning through data-driven models of students’ collaborative interactions by matching video and log data. The models successfully detected off-task behavior (43.2% above chance-level accuracy) and task-related talk (34.5% above chance) as students solved problems using a collaborative sketching tool. Future work will investigate how these models can be used to allow instructors to intervene effectively to support collaborative learning through the use of data-driven tools which will provide them with live information about the students’ behaviors.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:09Z (GMT).

How does the joint writing influence their historical understanding? We analyzed the joint accounts produced by post-primary Israeli students, Jews and Arabs, who collaboratively e-investigated events related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Employing a thematic analysis and a Bakhtinian-inspired discourse analysis, we found that the joint texts were constructed of themes from both in-groups’ perspectives. Students constructed a dialogic relationship between these themes, which enabled them to legitimize the other’s voice, yet keep the voices unmerged. These texts reflect a new historical meaning and a better understanding of the nature of history.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:10Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Total eye gaze duration analyses revealed that students spent significantly more time attending to the critical rather than to the confirmatory feedback they received.

Practice-based learning activities with a focus on Science, Technology, Art, Math and Engineering (STEAM) are providing new opportunities for teaching these subjects. However, we lack widely accepted ways of assessing and monitoring these practices to inform educators and learners, and enable the provision of effective support. Here, we report the results from a study with 15 teenage students taking part in a 2-day Hack. We present the results from analysis of video data recording collaborative working between groups of students. The analysis of the video data is completed using the ERICAP analytical framework (Luckin et al., 2017) based on ecology of resources and interactive, constructive, active and passive concepts. The results illustrate the differences between students’ engagement with resources which might be utilized as signifiers of student success in similar learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:15Z (GMT).

This knowledge was described by the TPACK (Technological, Pedagogical and Content Knowledge) framework, and it is assumed to be best acquired by teachers’ participation in Learning by Design (LbD) practice. However, little is known about the relationships between LbD, TPACK and technology integration (TI) in the classroom. A survey involving N = 101 US American secondary school mathematics teachers was conducted in a northeastern state to address this research gap and, surprisingly, it revealed non-linear relationships. These suggest that, while TPACK partially mediates the LbD-TI relationship as expected, technological knowledge can have a saturation effect on TI, and both LbD and TPACK can, under certain circumstances, decrease TI. Consequences for further research and teacher professional development practice are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:17Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this paper, we present a design case as an iterative sequence of evolving conjecture maps. As each conjecture map was tested, we revised it to highlight and refine our articulation of the tools and processes that embodied our design approach. Our design case involves small-town and rural community and school libraries in the United States as partners and DBR sites, with the goal of supporting librarians as they learn to develop and enact new STEM-oriented maker programs for youth. We show how conjecture mapping informed and supported our DBR work and how it helped push for specificity in hypothesized relations between the design, the learning setting, the outcomes, while also forcing a reflection on design constraints.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:17Z (GMT).

It has also been proven that visualizing given levels of knowledge guide co-learners’ questions and answers during the exchange. However, the question remains unanswered as to what extent visualized relative and absolute levels of knowledge have an influence on behavior. To find an answer to this question, which could also be used for optimizing complementarity-based group formations, we have systematically varied learners’ knowledge levels relative to learning partners’ levels (continuous distance) and absolute levels of knowledge (three levels) in 33 visualizations to investigate associated question and explanation intentions. The results confirm a strong influence of distances on intentions, moderated by absolute knowledge levels. In addition, we report from which distance learners decide to ask questions or provide explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:18Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We conducted a study with 254 university students enrolled in introductory computer science, pairing based on the goal they reported for that day. Results with a comparison condition show that matching by goal may not benefit student learning unless other factors are also considered. However, for students who hold a mastery goal, pairing with another student who shares that goal may significantly improve the learning experience. These results advance our understanding of how we might adapt collaborative learning practices based on students' goals.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:19Z (GMT).

Analyzing workshop observations and interviews of focus groups, we addressed the following research questions: (1) How did biodesign activities reflect science practices as characterized in national science standards? and (2) What did students have to say about their experiences with bio-design activities?

The danger is that this approach excludes some students who may not be drawn to coding, leaving them to think that our technological society has no place for them or their unique talents, skills, and passions.  In this paper, we present our work with third and fourth graders to use an instructional design framework to involve children in a design and development project that includes coding but also other non-coding activities. We argue that the instructional design process can be a way of engaging children in our technological society in meaningful ways while still making a place for a wide variety of skills and interests.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:24Z (GMT).

I systematically analyze recordings made over a year of science engagement in one family, showing how science was infused in many aspects of its life. However, whereas this engagement supported the development of a science-person identity for one child, it worked to develop a science-antagonist identity for the other. To explore how positioning and roles may help elucidate such local variation, I zoom in on the moment-by-moment interaction in one illuminating event. The analysis reveals how repeating identification within everyday family interactions can help explain differences in identity development. It suggests considering informal science learning environments also as leading to alienation from science and exploring how equal access to science is denied in subtle ways that go beyond socio-historical categories.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:26Z (GMT).

The emergence of visual, block-based programming environments such as Scratch and Alice have created a new pathway into computing, bringing creativity and playfulness into introductory computing contexts. Building on these successes, national curricular efforts in the United States are starting to incorporate block-based programming into instructional materials alongside, or in place of, conventional text-based programming. To understand if this decision is helping learners from historically underrepresented populations succeed in computing classes, this paper presents an analysis of over 5,000 students answering questions presented in both block-based and text-based modalities. A comparative analysis shows that while all students perform better when questions are presented in the block-based form, female students and students from historically underrepresented minorities saw the largest improvements. This finding suggests the choice of representation can positively affect groups historically marginalized in computing.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:27Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The initial PD group includes educators from public schools, charter schools, and afterschool programs. We are using a design-based approach to (1) create a sustainable, ongoing professional development program for educators of middle-school students; (2) develop a library of curricular materials for Skyscraper Games; and (3) enhance and upgrade our website and online programming tool. The goals of these activities are (1) to better understand how the interaction of professional development, curricular materials, and our online tool affect computational thinking for young people and (2) to use these results to iteratively improve our professional development, curriculum, and web-based tools for use by both middle-school students and their teachers in formal and informal settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:29Z (GMT).

While some studies use multiple theories, and attempt to bridge the frameworks, most use a single theory, considering learning from just one perspective. We argue that this can lead to a reduction in what we can understand about learning from each study, and has implications for the quality of designs and limits the possibility of uptake of CSCL tools beyond the specific research context. Drawing on other fields, we identify the potential and need for an ecological framework to inform research and design work, and argue for its importance in the development of the CSCL field.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:35Z (GMT).

This paper analyzes two case studies of cosplayers-hobbyists who make their own costumes of media characters to wear at fan conventions-who benefited from a well-developed connected learning ecology. Cases were drawn from a larger interview study and further analyzed as compelling examples of connected learning. Important themes that emerged included sponsorship by family, friends, and adult mentors; unique pathways that start with a difficult challenge; and comparisons with formal school experiences. This has implications for how we can design connected learning ecologies that support all learners on unique pathways toward fulfilling futures.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:40Z (GMT).

This review analyzes emerging research on social media with younger learners. Using PRISMA standards, we considered 1321 articles, selecting 48 reviewed here. We find that research on social media in K-12 learning is increasing rapidly, yet largely failing to study impacts on learning. Research is taking place across the globe on a variety of social media platforms, but the majority continues to look at the oldest K-12 learners. Few studies use control groups or comprehensively use analytic data collected by social media platforms. We highlight opportunities for scaling K-12 learning with social media globally and call for educators to engage more with social media developers and owners. With this overview, we offer an agenda for future learning sciences research, policy, practice and commercial development in this growing field.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:44Z (GMT).

GenEvo belongs to a class of constructionist learning environments that we call Emergent Systems Microworlds (ESM) which combine two design approaches: agent-based modeling of emergent systems and constructionism. An increased emphasis on learning scientific inquiry practices through the use of models has created demand for model-based curricula that incorporate authentic disciplinary inquiry practices. We argue that the design of GenEvo allows students to engage with disciplinary ideas central to modern biology, as well as complex systems thinking that is crucial in contemporary biological research. We also demonstrate that GenEvo makes advanced disciplinary ideas accessible to students in two very different global research settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:46Z (GMT).

Participants (N=24) were in their first semester of under-graduate teacher preparation. Qualitative data from written-reflections, semi-structured interviews and recorded audio-video observations were collected and compared to an ordinal ranking of groups’ collaborative instruction. Content analysis indicated pre-service perceptions of past collaborative experiences could be characterized as either a flexible orientation toward collaboration or an inflexible orientation toward collaboration. Discourse analysis indicated that pre-service perceptions of past collaborative experiences impacted students’ current collaborative efforts and outcomes. Students with a flexible orientation collaborated with higher quality interactions than students with an inflexible orientation. In turn, groups with members having a flexible orientation created and delivered higher quality collaborative instruction than groups with only members having an inflexible orientation.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:52Z (GMT).

Despite the importance of strategic iteration, we lack precise understandings of effective iterative planning and novice challenges, making it difficult to assess formatively and therefore to teach. We conducted design-based research to understand iterative planning and design assessment tools in a full-time 6-week program where undergraduate teams worked on social impact design problems. We found that iterative planning requires a process of risk analysis: detecting risks in the problem space, prioritizing those risks, and setting goals to reduce them. Novices struggled with each step of risk analysis, so they did not plan iterations strategically. We designed assessment tools that surface students’ thinking about risk analysis and support instructors to notice common challenges. We contribute detailed understandings of iterative planning and novice challenges as well as tools that can be adapted to assess real-world problem solving across domains.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:41:53Z (GMT).

Data sources for this study included field notes, video, student artifacts, assessments, and student interviews. Students developed emergent understandings of the concept of energy transfer and the role of models to test, refine, and communicate ideas. This study has implications for the design and incorporation of scientific modeling tasks in curricula, as well as the field’s understanding of the development of upper elementary students’ sense-making regarding the concept of energy transfer.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:02Z (GMT).

Our findings confirm that characteristics of staff diversity and equity orientation of work-placement organizations can support or hinder positive learning outcomes. However, we also found that both strengths and limitations in terms of diversity and equity, in concert with other supportive factors, can be productive resources within the context of future goal setting for youth of color.

In this study, we utilize the framework of ‘learning as the organization of social futures’ – one that simultaneously foregrounds values and their expressions within learning activity – to understand orientations of informal digital learning organizations. The study focuses on three organizations, all part of a larger research-practice partnership. Utilizing staff interviews and organizational documentation, our findings show that the kinds of social futures valued by informal digital learning organizations varied in (1) how specified versus open-ended these futures were, (2) their focus on access to existing social futures vs creation of alternative social realities in order to allow new possible futures, (3) their relative focus on individual versus collective futures, with each of these dimensions having implications in terms of ways that pedagogies are designed within these organizations.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:10Z (GMT).

To successfully infuse CT into K-8 settings, we must equip pre-service teachers with CT knowledge and skills that can be applied in their curricular context. This work presents trajectories of pre-service teacher knowledge development of CT concepts and computing tools within the context of disciplinary content and pedagogical knowledge through their participation in an educational technology course. Data were collected from a random sample of 42 pre-service teachers. Data sources included participants’ lesson plans (N=126) collected through three different time points. These materials were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Preliminary results indicated that pre-service teachers gradually improved their understanding throughout their participation in the course. Findings also revealed difficulties in conceptualizing and integrating CT in conjunction with content and pedagogy, particularly during authentic vis-à-vis hypothetical lesson designs.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:11Z (GMT).

We present teachers' weekly meeting at which a group of teachers interpreted two sets of markers in students' online discussion using Knowledge Forum®. They are (i) keywords as content markers and (ii) Knowledge Building scaffold support as epistemic markers.

The expansiveness or narrowness of how making and makers are conceived by adult mentors in such contexts thus becomes important to the democratizing potential of makerspaces. This paper examines how adult mentors in a nationally recognized U.S. public library makerspace, who are mentoring racially and socioeconomically diverse teens, conceptualize their practice. We present an analysis of semi-structured interviews with these mentors, which proceded from a broader study that also included participant observation of makerspace activity and focal interviews of participating youth. Our findings have relevance to the broader effort to establish models of makerspaces at public institutions, dedicated to democratizing access to powerful ideas and practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:20Z (GMT).

Building on claims that knowledge building communities are idea-centered, as well as recent research in this area that has looked at learning holistically, we examine the notion of a ‘humanistic knowledge building community’ as an integration of idea-centered classroom knowledge building communities with Rogerian person-centeredness. We investigated an innovative course for graduate students in an educational technologies program that both inspired and informed this conceptualization. The results of our research led to an operational KES framework that reveals different patterns of interconnections between students’ evolving knowledge, experience, and self. In this study we report on these through the lens of a single student.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:21Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It also helped teachers display student work to build off their thinking and promote a growth mindset. This study has implications for the design technology and professional development that promote formative assessment, classroom discourse, and growth mindset thinking beyond a math classroom.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:27Z (GMT).

In this study, the complicated nature of science practices is framed and traced by drawing on the notion of “science as a mangle of practice.” From this notion, the dialectical relationship between human and non-human agency constitutes science through the dynamic process of resistance and accommodation. Tackling these dialectical agencies may allow us to effectively capture a snapshot of students’ lab activities and science practices. Methodologically, the study demonstrates how the combined use of social network analysis and discourse analysis may provide insight into the complicated nature of this mangled science practice. The study also explores the advantages of using a 360 VR camera, providing an immersive view while reducing blind spots.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:30Z (GMT).

Science, in particular, is emerging as an important discipline to support integrated learning. This highlights the need for carefully designed assessments targeting the integration of science and CT to help teachers and researchers gauge students’ proficiency with integrating the disciplines. We describe a principled design process to develop assessment tasks and rubrics that integrate concepts and practices across science, CT, and computational modeling. We conducted a pilot study with 10 high school students who responded to integrative assessment tasks as part of a physics-based computational modeling unit. Our findings indicate that the tasks and rubrics successfully elicit both Physics and CT constructs while distinguishing important aspects of proficiency related to the two disciplines. This work illustrates the promise of using such assessments formatively in integrated STEM and computing learning contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:32Z (GMT).

This is done by considering materials and reports from a form of a “construction site” for science: the implementation of laboratory science in a high school chemistry classroom. The paper considers how the collective operates in three domains central to the learning sciences: learning environments, discourse, and identity. Implications for the relation of this to other ways of considering artifacts and inscriptions, including material feminisms, and for the for the role of phenomena in learning are also discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:36Z (GMT).

This study investigated the hypothesis that greater coupling between the physical space and the narrative of the AR activity leads to enhanced immersion and learning. Forty-five middle school students participated in this study: students in Condition1 (n=22) participated in an AR activity with strong coupling between the narrative and the physical space, while students in Condition2 (n=23) participated in a loose coupling version of the activity. Data collection included baseline data, questionnaires investigating students’ immersion and learning gains, as well as post-activity interviews. Findings showed higher learning gains and increased immersion for the students participating in the strong coupling condition than for the students in the loose coupling condition.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:42Z (GMT).

Hundred undergraduates were randomly assigned to either read a refutation text and then conduct a peer discussion (Ref+Arg), or to read a refutation (RefOnly) or an expository (Control) text, followed by a standard, individual problem solving task. Results showed strong effects for refutation texts on both immediate and delayed post-tests. Contrary to expectations, subsequent peer argumentation did not further improve learning gains. Dyadic dialogue protocols analyses showed that gaining dyads were overall more likely to be symmetrical and to include a discussion of the core principles of natural selection. Several directions for future research are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:42:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

One case draws from video data of an urban high school robotics team which designs a robot for competition, and the other from a program where youth produce a documentary film for a public showing. Building on a view of participation as learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991), we use video-based micro-analysis to make sense of how members participate through contributions to design. We frame learning as a collaborative practice where contributions are used to make arguments with different resources. Across both cases, materials and laminations of space-times (Leander, 2002) are used as: 1) evaluative resources, and 2) knowledge constructing resources for design. In this view of learning, the final product and performance are not only end goals but used as resources in the design process through laminations of imagined future space-times.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:03Z (GMT).

This study complements previous research by taking a zoomed-in perspective including multimodal data streams (i.e. audiovisual, self-report, logdata and psycho-physiological data) to fully understand the effects on the teaching and learning mechanisms. Although we did not find statistically significant effects regarding the conceptual understanding, the results of the affective outcome and process variables are consistent with the growing body of evidence that generating solutions to novel problems prior to instruction can improve deeper learning and can make teaching more interactive and student-centered.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:04Z (GMT).

In implementing and integrating these technologies there are challenges both with regard to developing the technologies themselves, and in aligning them with existing, or transformable, practices. In this paper we argue that by ‘augmenting’ formative tasks with learning analytics, we can achieve impact both through the integration of the tools, and through the support of existing good practices. We exemplify our approach through its application to the design of tasks for the key skill of learning how to write effectively. The development of these designs and their abstractions holds significant potential in bridging research and practice, by supporting the sharing and interrogation of designs in a way that is intimately tied to both practice (practical applied contexts), and research (through theorized and empirically supported designs targeting particular learning outcomes).","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:07Z (GMT).

Using answer sequence data from three Khan Academy exercises, we generate high-dimensional vector representations of incorrect student answers using a model of distributed representation more commonly applied to natural language. After clustering wrong answers in the learned vector space, we use these clusters as the basis for analysis of student misconceptions with a quantitative comparison to manual coding and a deeper qualitative discussion based on a constructivist framework. The result is a demonstration of how big data from conventional tutoring systems can act as a bridge to more critical pedagogies from the learning sciences via a distributed, connectionist model of student concept formation.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:08Z (GMT).

This paper lays out three concerns often raised about the use of EDS/LA approaches in learning sciences work: reliance on algorithmic processing over human insight, attention to generalized structures over contextualized processes, and emphasis on empirical findings over theory building. Through an overview of work conducted on the MOOCeology project it then shows specific ways that such concerns can be meaningfully addressed. The paper concludes by elucidating a set of seven initial principles for “learning sciences aware” EDS/LA work and opening the question of to what extent these principles might be appropriate to guide EDS/LA work more broadly.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:09Z (GMT).

Thus, we propose two ideas to develop an assessment system: first, a collaboration between humans and AI by utilizing teachers’ assessment efforts to advance the knowledge of both, and second, an embedment of the collaboration in the DBIR community. Study 1 introduces the case of a veteran teacher who turned the PDCA cycle twice by finding a problem in his lesson with his colleagues using a dialogue analysis tool and by hitting upon a new plan, which engendered more productive students’ dialogues, which referred to the expected keywords. Study 2 demonstrates the effects of the pre-registration of keywords into a dialogue transcription system on the recognition rate.

In this paper, we explore MOOC learners’ discourse by employing Group Communication Analysis (GCA), a methodology for quantifying and characterizing the discourse between learners in online interactions. Commonly used approaches in MOOCs derive insight into the learning processes from aggregated text or structural data. In contrast, GCA makes use of linguistic cohesion analysis across sequences of learners’ interactions in multi-party communication. GCA calculates six inter- and intra-personal sociocognitive measures of such interactions and from these identify distinct interaction profiles through a cluster analysis. With this method, we were able to diagnostically reveal four robust profiles amongst MOOC learners. This study presents a unique analysis of the sociocognitive processes that comprise the interaction between learners. The scalability of the methodology opens the door for future research efforts directed towards understanding and improving scaled peer-interactions.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:11Z (GMT).

Broadly speaking, this theme complements (or pushes back against) the notion of purely abstract, “disembodied” cognition and emphasizes the role of physical interaction with the environment in the course of learning and development. A common, if usually implicit, assumption in this work is that learners’ bodies are more or less constant from one era to another: after all, human senses, limbs, physiology, and the basic parameters of cognition are part of an ongoing evolutionary human endowment. This assumption, while historically reasonable, is likely to need reconsideration in the near future, as a variety of “transhumanist” technologies (enhanced senses, bodies, and internalized interfaces with the outside physical environment) become more prevalent in children’s lives. This paper discusses several foundational issues and questions that are poised to emerge, and to challenge our enduring ideas about children and education, in the foreseeable future.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:12Z (GMT).

Peer mediated feedback (Walker, Rummel, & Koedinger, 2009) can be supported by including simple prompts and further supported by attending to an activity system (Kaptelinin & Nardi, 2012), which includes the software system and classroom context to support student facilitation.

The experiment subtly altered gendered situational cues in course videos, placing either male or female data scientists in video backgrounds and using matching male or female aides for tutorial videos. The experiment explores whether prior work on ambient cues would generalize beyond a physical classroom environment and into an online environment at scale. We find strong evidence that the female condition induces strong positive effects on overall course activity and discussion posting behavior by female students, but also strong evidence of a smaller negative effect on these outcomes for male students. We find no effect on students’ persistence through the course. This experiment suggests that subtle personalized alterations of educational environments can influence students’ engagement patterns in large-scale digital learning environments, but that gendered interventions may negatively impact some students.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:14Z (GMT).

Direct communication between experts and non-experts has been facilitated by social media. However, little attention has been given to the processes and outcomes of these communication events, and particularly, to the goals and constraints of the experts. Here, we characterize experts' considerations for answering science- and health-related questions on a questions-and-answers (Q&A) Facebook group dedicated to vaccines. Results indicate that experts have a diverse set of goals and constraints, including disseminating knowledge, defending science and calming fears. Constraints include maintaining collegiality and avoiding provision of medical advice. In light of the findings, we propose a concept of experts' ""bounded engagement with the public.""","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

I highlight three emerging areas of research with current research exemplars. First, simulating affect is necessary to enhance human-like relationships with technology; for example, with artificially intelligent virtual agents, or teachable robots as learning companions. Second, sensing and responding to learner affect in immersive learning experiences as well as learning at scale is rapidly evolving; for example, through affective intelligent tutoring systems, or dashboards driven by multimodal analytics. Third, designing technology-based learning experiences that promote, elicit and support affective outcomes requires theory building within the learning sciences; for example, to realize outcomes such as empathy or curiosity and formulate linkages to learning. Finally, I suggest how research in these areas of affective technology afford new opportunities to prepare learners for future learning and work environments","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:16Z (GMT).

We draw specifically on Noddings' care theory (1984, 1986), which foregrounds concern for collective well-being and growth. In particular, we explore what a caring orientation can look like in the context of doing science through two paradigmatic cases. These cases highlight how values of receptiveness, responsiveness, and relatedness shape students' social and epistemic practice. These values challenge canonical versions of science practice and invite reflection on the moral underpinnings of learning science.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:27Z (GMT).

Using a custom designed technology environment called CKBiology, these representations captured the real-time progress of the learning community at three levels of granularity: Individual students, small groups, and whole class. Our results focus on the perspectives of students and teachers, triangulating data from a student questionnaire, teacher interview, and CKBiology log files to identify how different representations of progress contributed to awareness, motivation, and the overall practices of the learning community.  Grounded in the theoretical model of Knowledge Community and Inquiry, this work seeks to strengthen connections between learning analytics research and the learning sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:38Z (GMT).

This work examines how three students approached making sense of literary texts in the context of year-long instruction designed to support students in building knowledge, skills, and practices around literary reasoning. Findings illustrate the complexities of teaching and learning literary reasoning by describing multiple pathways in how students’ own knowledge and experience was used to bridge the text and the world. This work has implications for designing spaces that value a variety of approaches towards literary reading while supporting interpretation of increasingly complex texts.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:39Z (GMT).

Participants had no prior programming experience, and we used a block-based environment with pre-made functions as well as video tutorials to scaffold the activity. We explored 2 interventions to support their collaboration: a real-time visualization of their verbal contribution and a short verbal explanation of the benefits of collaboration for learning. This paper describes our experimental design, the effect of the interventions, preliminary results from the Kinect sensor, and our future plans to analyze additional sensor data. We conclude by highlighting the importance of capturing and supporting 21st century skills (i.e., collaboration and effective communication) in small groups of students.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:40Z (GMT).

However, students may be hesitant to present different views to maintain interpersonal relationships, hindering communication and integration of multiple perspectives. Social networking sites (SNS) have been used to extend classroom discussions to such real-world topics. However, their flat-structured layout may not suit argumentation activities. This quasi-experiment in an applied classroom setting investigates the effects of a group awareness tool (GAT) that combines social (group members’ names) and cognitive (discussion points/ stance in initial arguments) information in a network graph to aid communication behavior and integration of multiple perspectives during argumentation on a flat-structured SNS. Students supported by the GAT engaged in discussions with non-friends and students outside their class more than the control group, though the latter integrated multiple perspectives more. The GAT appears to have increased familiarity among non-friends. The potential influence of interpersonal relationships on integration of multiple perspectives is discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We do so by drawing on two examples of existing research. The first is our prior work attempting to automate part of the Classroom Video Analysis assessment, which seeks to measure knowledge of teachers that is predictive of their performance. The second is from work which looks at how middle school students explain the Earth's seasons. In that work, we attempted to use unsupervised methods to capture elements of what was previously a fully qualitative analysis. Our goal is to provide the reader with a sense for this style of research that brings qualitative analysis and analytic methods into closer contact. To accomplish this, we make use of a new system called Tactic, designed specifically to support this mode of research.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:43Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This paper provides initial empirical validation for EVT-HS, while also introducing and providing support for costs of seeking help from a particular help source impacting intention to seek help. Our survey experiment shows that raising perceived expectancies and values for a help source significantly predicts a student’s intention to seek help. Our results also show that evaluation anxiety, as a potential negative value, inversely predicts intentions to seek help from a particular source.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:44Z (GMT).

In this paper, I offer a set of pathways that characterize this work towards justice in the learning sciences, work which reflects a variety of means and ends. The pathways are: (1) Consider the goals of an equity-oriented framework for learning; (2) Theoretically, draw on existing critical social theory; (3) Methodologically, focus on collaborative change-making, and; (4) Support heterogeneity in knowing and doing. These pathways are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive, but rather provide an assessment of the current justice-oriented landscape in the learning sciences. I then argue that heterogeneity in means and ends towards addressing learning inequities is fruitful for the field and offer some open questions with which the critical learning sciences has yet to fully contend.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:45Z (GMT).

Yet their effectiveness depends upon the kinds of supports students receive. In this study, we explore the verbal and gestural supports we provided to students as they viewed a computer model of molecular conduction and constructed causal-mechanistic explanations for heat transfer. Using a complex systems and embodied approach to students’ conceptions, we conducted a cross-comparison case study of four students’ experiences with the simulation. By comparing students with richer scaffolding interactions to those with weaker scaffolds, we found that directing student attention towards causal elements in the simulation along with requesting them to gesture about the function of those elements helped students develop sophisticated explanations. We describe these cases and reveal ways these scaffolds can and cannot be enacted with the simulation. Implications for instruction and future work are described.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:46Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In Bots for Tots, a design-based research project in three locations over two years, builders create a ""dream toy"" for a younger member of their local community. We hypothesized that building for others would appeal to young girls that may not typically see building robots and racecars as aligning with their goals and values. Data indicates participating girls consistently considered their ""client"" throughout the design process and were interested in continuing to build for others after the project ended. We show how the degree to which the ""other"" impacts the construction process depends on the quality of the relationship between builder and client.

Collaborative activities may help students overcome these difficulties, especially if collaboration scripts prompt students to discuss shared representations. Which representation should collaboration scripts focus students’ interactions on? We investigate this question in a quasi-experiment with 560 undergraduate chemistry students. All students collaboratively built physical ball-and-stick models of molecules and translated them into wedge-dash drawings. Two experimental conditions received a collaboration script. For the model condition, the script prompted students to focus on the physical ball-and-stick models. For the draw condition, the script prompted students to generate intermediary drawings on paper. Compared to a control condition with unscripted collaboration, the model condition showed higher learning gains and the draw condition showed lower learning gains—especially for students with low spatial skills. Our results yield theoretical and practical implications for collaborative practices with multiple representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Through the lens of honeybee nectar collection, we worked with three first-grade classrooms assigned to one of three conditions -- instruction through use of a first-person perspective only, third-person perspective only, and integrated instruction -- to engage ideas of complex systems thinking. In each condition, systems concepts were targeted through instruction and assessment. The combined and third-person classrooms demonstrated significant gains while the first-person classroom showed gains that were not statistically significant, suggesting that third-person perspectives play a critical role in how children learn systems thinking. This work also puts forth a novel assessment design for young children using multiple-choice questions.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This paper is a case study examining how one group of high school biology teachers drew upon two different learning progressions (evolution and carbon cycle) over the course of one academic year as they designed and enacted formative assessment tasks, and then interpreted responses to the tasks. We find that the progressions were taken up differently and may have provided central ideas for the curricular units but primarily acted as tools for facilitators to frame discussion around student ideas. Our findings suggest the progressions appeared not to be ready-to-use tools for teachers in these new contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We review and synthesize literature on performance tasks, three-dimensional task design, and research into student thinking about energy. Then, working with examples from a research-practice partnership, we identify three tensions that have emerged in the process of design: tension between practice-as-embodied in the task and the current state of practice in our partner district, tensions in creating scorable outcome space as students model and explain energy across systems, and tension in asking students to represent energy in ways that pose challenges for disciplinary experts. We close by summarizing ongoing challenges for assessment designers engaged in designing assessments for crosscutting concepts.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:53Z (GMT).

Students in the Collaborative U condition maintained their initial high positive attitudes and understanding of collaboration from pre to post, whereas students in the control condition showed a decline. Furthermore, students who completed Collaborative U rated team process and final products significantly higher than those in the control condition on a variety of attributes.

Few studies have followed the long-term trajectories of early computer science learners. We present a longitudinal study of a school cohort (N=48) across a three-year computer science curriculum in grades 6-8. We analyzed students' Scratch projects in terms of elaboration and computational thinking content, and modeled their association with performance on a summative open-ended assessment of computational thinking. Both metrics were associated with performance on the summative task, but engagement had a much more substantial effect. This supports the idea that early computer science experience should be designed to support students in working on personally-meaningful projects. Developing computational literacy practices may be more important for long-term growth in computational thinking than a primary emphasis on content knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:55Z (GMT).

Theories of extended cognition accentuate looking beyond the body and mind of an individual, thus here we examine how gestural embodied actions become distributed over multiple learners confronting mathematical tasks. We identify several ways in which gesture can be used collaboratively, and explore patterns in how collaborative gestures seem to arise in a learning environment involving a motion capture game for geometry. Learners use collaborative gestures to extend mathematical ideas over multiple bodies as they explore, refine, and extend each other’s reasoning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:56Z (GMT).

The Next Generation Science Standards demonstrate the importance of these disciplinary tools by directly incorporating science, mathematics, and engineering with computing in grades K-12.  To assist children with learning the knowledge and skills authentic to these disciplines, we need teachers with appropriate content and pedagogical knowledge of computing.  However, most K-12 teachers have little to no computing background.  This design-based research study explores how designing professional development (PD) with faded scaffolds and worked examples can further teacher training efforts to bring computing to core content classes. Forty-six teachers participated in summer PD opportunities that introduced them to electronic textiles as a vehicle for integrating computing into their science classrooms. The professional and curriculum development processes evolved through an iterative design intended to build better scaffolds for teacher and student learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:57Z (GMT).

We explore how to integrate wearable-based inquiry into early-elementary classrooms with Live Physiological Sensing and Visualization tools, including: designing age-appropriate scaffolds, adapting to teacher perspectives, and meeting Next Generation Science Standards. We conducted a two-year, iterative process of developing scaffolds and implementing them in four elementary classrooms (two teachers; 90 children). We present two case studies to demonstrate how our participatory designed scaffolds impact the authenticity of the learners’ wearable-based inquiry experience. Our findings contribute insights about facilitating wearable-based inquiry with elementary learners and specific supports for using sensor-based learning systems to meet Next Generation Science Standards.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:43:58Z (GMT).

While learning scientists regularly measure teacher outcomes and learner outcomes, data are rarely collected on other dimensions of scale that are important for uncovering practices and designs that achieve wide-reaching, long-term impact on learning, notably: spread of underlying norms and beliefs, sustainability of use, and shift of ownership into the hands of the practitioners using the learning environments. This paper describes an instrument for measuring these scale outcomes with a focus on a particular component of learning environments: curriculum materials. By presenting both the instrument and results from its pilot use, this paper offers a conceptual as well as a methodological contribution toward developing much-needed instrumentation for evaluating the outcomes of learning environments at scale.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:00Z (GMT).

Engaging students in practices allows for a deeper learning of content and a more productive understanding of how scientific knowledge is developed. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of student learning in practice, assessments have to simultaneously address students’ understanding of content and practice. In order to investigate the kinds of heuristics that may assist in developing such assessments, we present data from parallel phenomenon-based modeling assessments given to 11th grade biology students. While students constructed structurally similar arguments, the amount and how content knowledge was used differed. Students were able to bring in content knowledge more readily when presented decontextualized phenomenon-based models and used this knowledge to make productive connections between evidence and provided models. We discuss heuristics and implications for design.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this simulation, children assumed the role of honeybees, whose job was to collect nectar from flowers and bring it back to a hive, learning about the social nature of honeybee colonies (e.g., the need for honeybees to communicate the location of nectar via a “waggle dance”). As we designed the simulation, we iteratively analyzed the ways that children in a range of low-tech and high-tech conditions engaged in creating a nonverbal system of communication. Findings suggest that the spatial layout of the simulation directly influenced the game’s difficulty levels and subsequently impacted both the nonverbal communication and the learning outcomes of the activity. This paper presents the iterative design cycles and outlines implications for studies seeking to design participatory simulations for young children.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:02Z (GMT).

This paper presents research on the development of adult facilitators in out-of-school programs that engage youth in creative computing experiences, where youth create, design, and build with technology. Facilitators are typically volunteers recruited from the local community, schools, and companies with varied backgrounds with youth, education, and technology. We examined the experiences of adult facilitators in an intergenerational learning program that supported youth and their parents to learn and create with technology. We describe three case studies of adults who developed multiple practices and roles and discuss what supported their development as facilitators. This study has implications for how informal learning organizations and programs can support facilitators from varied backgrounds to support diverse learners in creative computing.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:03Z (GMT).

Moreover, such work often analyzes the direct impact of dyadic features like rapport on learning, without considering the role played by individual factors, such as learners’ prior knowledge and self-efficacy. In this paper, we investigate the intertwined impact that rapport, self-efficacy, and prior knowledge have on the process and outcomes of peer tutoring. We find that peer tutors in high-rapport dyads offer more help and prompt their tutees to explain their reasoning more than low-rapport dyads, with tutees in such dyads verbalizing their problem-solving process and proposing more steps and answers. Meanwhile, rapport is associated with increased procedural performance, but tutees’ self-efficacy and prior knowledge moderate the effect of rapport on tutees’ conceptual performance.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:04Z (GMT).

In this paper, we contrast two pairs that exhibited positive and negative learning gains. We first detail multimodal measures to compare differences and similarities across those groups, and then dive deeper into a qualitative analysis of their exchanges. We then describe how those measures could be used over the entire sample to capture productive interactions in small groups. We conclude by discussing how process data from sensors can augment traditional qualitative observations, and how it can create powerful synergies for better understanding collaborative interactions among learners in settings such as makerspaces.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:05Z (GMT).

Focusing on the design and enactment of two focal texts and associated tasks, we ask: (1) How did the design and enactment of the texts and tasks support third-graders' science and literacy learning? (2) How might modifications to the design of the texts and tasks better support student learning? Findings indicate ways in which the design of the texts and tasks, and the teacher's enactment, synergistically supported students' science and literacy learning, but also point to missed opportunities in the design of the curriculum and its enactment, for further supporting the learning of all students.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:06Z (GMT).

Our study is motivated by two observations. First, play has characteristics reminiscent of professional mathematicians’ practice. Second, the child-centeredness of play points to possibilities for equitable mathematics instruction. We conceptualize problem solving in construction play as the process children engage in when they experience trouble accomplishing a goal and work to repair it. To examine this phenomenon, we used head-mounted GoPros to collect 348 point-of-view videos of children as they played in a mathematical playground, where “messing around” with designed objects provided them with opportunities to encounter mathematical concepts. Through a close examination of one case, we illustrate the mathematical generativity of play with the designed objects and argue that children’s construction play can support rich opportunities for children’s mathematical sensemaking.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:07Z (GMT).

This paper focuses mostly on observations of instruction within schools that were assigned to use the new digital resources. Compared to a business-as-usual control group, the structure of classroom activity and teaching practices changed in the treatment group. Observers, who were blind to student achievement outcomes, found two overall patterns in treatment classrooms across five categories of observations. Later quantitative analysis indeed found the ""high"" and ""low"" patterns could account for some of the variance in achievement outcomes within the treatment condition. We explore observed patterns in terms of existing learning science theory and suggest areas where further development of the learning sciences may be needed and how learning sciences can contribute to improvement of digital, blended learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:08Z (GMT).

As such, teacher’s should not overlook it when teaching programming. The main aim of the study is to use gaze data combined with measures at different temporal granularities to show how these measures are related to the outcomes (in particular debugging success as a learning by doing outcome) students have at the end of the debugging task. The results delineate that combining gaze data with actions (reading, writing, scrolling) and unit tasks (main method and JUnit test) gives new insights to further understand the cognitive actions in debagging a program. Moreover, this study also focuses on discovering debugging patterns of successful students in order to improve the design of learning activities to teach students how to debug. Finally, with the analysis, the authors have shown an automatic way of detecting successful action-gaze patterns.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:10Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We present a case study analysis (n=26) and demonstrate how teacher moves aligned with our model of instructional improvisation support joint ownership of science knowledge and students having agency within science learning. After demonstrating the effects of these moves, we end with a discussion of how teachers might intentionally use instructional improvisation to support productive interactions in inquiry-based science classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:11Z (GMT).

We extend this work by developing new kinds of practice spaces that do not attempt to fully simulate teaching, but rather offer playful and creative opportunities for novice teachers to develop skills and dispositions valuable for teachers. We summarize six different practice spaces developed through design research, and then articulate a set of design considerations emerging from this work to expand the genre of pedagogies of enactment in teacher professional development.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:12Z (GMT).

This paper describes the design of two learning opportunities, which draw on Actor Network Theory, for assisting state science coordinators in exploring complex educational systems in their state. We respond to a call for research on how representational tools can help education leaders develop understandings of complex systems. The authors conducted a design study to address the question, how do state science education leaders use representations of complex systems to understand their networks and identify leverage points for change?","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:13Z (GMT).

We examine the co-design process of an interdisciplinary group of teachers crafting a transdisciplinary art-science-computation curriculum unit for their classrooms. Within this context, teachers engaged in richly metarepresentational discussions wherein they applied values and practices from all three constituent fields of study in their design work. We present the results of a qualitative analysis of teacher discourse, showing the wide variety of epistemic criteria marshalled by teachers within design discussions as they connected their ordinarily separate disciplines.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:14Z (GMT).

The construct of rightful presence – and the co-constructed “making present” practices which give rise to moments of rightful presence – is one way to consider more systemically how to make sense of the historicized and relational nature of teaching and learning. Our study shows how integrating the equity-oriented design approach, community ethnography as pedagogy, as a part of teaching and learning STEM, supports the emergences of making present practices: modeling ethnographic data, re-performing injustices towards understanding and solidarity, and making change dynamic and visible in classroom work. These practices and their implications are described using ethnographic data from 6 urban middle school classrooms in two states during a STEM unit focused on engineering for sustainable communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2018-11-04T22:44:15Z (GMT).
