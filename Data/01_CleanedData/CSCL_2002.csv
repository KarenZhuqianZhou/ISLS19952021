We develop our argument by presenting illustrative analyses of two data extracts concerned with the development of shared knowledge, the negotiation of goals and the conditional relevance of technological tools.

Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is a method for bringing the power of technology to support collaborative and contextual learning.

Analyzing the children’s level of programming achievement, we found that gender does not affect programming performance. Regression analysis shows that performance is correlated with prior programming experience and time on task. Boys are more likely than girls to have prior programming experience, and spend more time programming on average.

In particular, it examines why the tutors’ aspirations of helping the students to collaborate were not met. It was found that students tended not to use the groupware, preferring other, self-developed support tools. Our study shows that the failure was multidetermined: there was a complex interacting set of factors including software use problems, systems integration issues, conflicting tutor/student perceptions of the value of using the groupware, and conflicts in each group’s view of how best to complete the course. There has been interest in using Activity Theory to approach multidimensional analysis in CSCL, but existing Activity Theory-based frameworks can be difficult to apply to instances of collaborative learning marked by conflict. To address this need, we use an Activity Theory-based analytic tool called the Activity Space. The tool is also used to show how multiple changes could be made to improve the potential for groupware to be used as intended.","Long

Our aim is to allow authors and teachers to generate a mapping from activity design to its implementation in a wirelessly networked classroom with ubiquitous use of handheld computers for information exchange. CML models e-learning workflows with three major components: actors, data objects, and interaction networks. Actors are the diverse performers of actions, data objects are the semantically typed information units that are made available for exchange. Interaction networks are virtual networks constructed on top of whatever network ClassSync is running on, and dictate how information may flow through the ClassSync system (from actor to actor). Activities are the processes performed via these three components, in which actors create and consume data objects and exchange them over an interaction network. The benefits of this approach for students, curriculum designers, teachers, publishers and learning sciences researchers are highlighted.","Long

Studying facilitation in a face to face situation provides some guidance in designing support to use in an online problem-based learning environment; however, considerable adaptation is necessary as some facilitation can be built into the system but some facilitation may need to be done by a human tutor.

Many different approaches to scaffolding techniques have been presented in a broad range of software tools. I discuss two mechanisms to explain how software tools can scaffold learners.

An aggregate statistical analysis revealed significant correlations between the quality of reflective observations provided, and the number and quality of responsive messages received from other team members. Conversely, high responsive message senders were associated with low quality messages. Reflective communicators were theorized to occupy a distinctive niche in the team, both as a source of high quality reflective observations and who engaged in high frequency, bi-directional responsive communications. Based on these criteria an individual analysis of the data revealed 13 reflective communicators among the 32 participants. Reflective communicators tended to communicate with other reflective communicators in groups containing multiple reflective communicators and increased these communications over time.

We report on an intervention study in a middle school where the entire teaching staff engaged in a year-long effort to change their instructional practices by means of incorporating information and communication technologies in pilot curriculum units. The teachers set out to make pedagogical changes along two dimensions, from procedure-oriented drill to problem- and principle-oriented knowledge production, and from encapsulated classroom work to networked learning in partnerships between the school and organizations outside. They employed conceptual models to anchor their change efforts ‘upward’ in a long-term general vision. They also anchored their change efforts ‘downward’, in videotaped examples of classroom practice. Technical tools were subordinate to a pedagogical object. For the pedagogical object to gain momentum and become a true motive for the teachers, they needed to take expansive actions that moved them from myth-driven to object-driven discourse. These expansive actions were actions of redefining the students as capable, and consequently redefining a new model of teaching as possible.","Long

Considerable public expenditure is being applied to the creation of on-line learning and on-line learner information services. These are seen as having a major role in stimulating learning in small businesses. The small business sector has traditionally proved reluctant to engage in structured programmes of employee development. While policy is finding application through significant spending on new infrastructure, insufficient attention is being paid to the ways in which those in the workplace learn and learn about learning. Drawing on research carried out in Scotland, this paper suggests that the development of ICT supported work-based learning will result in significant changes in learning relationships and in the sources from which learners seek support. The effective development of learning in small businesses is dependent on the radical changes in technology associated with ICT being matched by equally radical changes in the way that work-based learning is conceptualised and organised. In particular, the potential of new learning relationships must be recognised and taken fully into account in planning and implementing work-based learning programmes. While positive for learners and the businesses in which they work, the changes in roles and relationships which the adoption of this perspective will involve will challenge and are likely to marginalize traditional players in the learning market.","Long

As a result, children who wish to collaborate using computers must adapt their interactions to the single-user paradigm most personal computers are based on. More recently, co-located groupware systems offering support for concurrent, multi-user interactions around a shared display have become technologically feasible. Unlike traditional groupware systems that provide multi-user interaction through the use of separate computers, these systems share the physical workspace, as well as the virtual workspace. These systems provide a unique mechanism through which children can interact with each other. However, ways to best utilize the technology in this manner has not been fully evaluated. This paper investigates how technological support for children’s synchronous interactions facilitates their collaborative activities. In particular, we examined whether a shared workspace facilitates the development of a shared understanding during a computer-based collaborative activity. We present a field study that observed pairs of children playing an educational game in several display configurations. The findings from this research suggest strengths and weaknesses of various types of support for synchronous interactions and discusses issues related to the design and development of more effective computer systems to support children’s face-toface interactions.","Long

KidPad, a 2½D drawing package with zooming capabilities, was adapted for use with multiple mice and tangible interfaces. The first section of the paper focuses on a study carried out to evaluate the effect of multiple mice on children’s collaborative behaviour at a desktop computer. Positive effects of the use of two mice included symmetry of mouse use amongst pairs and a greater degree of engagement in the task. However a number of usability issues were identified when children attempted to collaborate, particular problems were faced when the shared control was taken away, and one of the users took control, for example, when navigating. Different types of working styles were also evident between the one mouse and two mice conditions. The second section of the paper describes a move away from the desktop computer towards room-based technologies. Tangible interfaces to KidPad were developed in order to facilitate shared control over actions such as navigation where difficulties had been identified in a desktop situation. The visibility of action is highlighted as a fundamental element in the support of collaboration on a larger scale. Finally, future work and the potential of these technologies in encouraging shareable co-present interaction in a real school context are briefly discussed.","Long

Sam was designed to appear as a peer to preschool children, but to tell stories in a developmentally advanced way in order to model narrative skills important for literacy. Literacy learning - learning how to read and write, begins long before children enter school. One of the key skills to reading and writing is the ability to represent thoughts symbolically and share them in language with an audience who does not share the same background. Children learn and practice such important language skills in the informal setting of everyday storytelling with their peers and adults available around them. In particular, storytelling in a context of peer collaboration provides a perfect place where children not only learn language skills important for literacy, but also learn to be critical listeners of others' stories. Preliminary evaluation showed that by interacting with Sam, 5-year-old children's stories more closely resembled Sam’s linguistically advanced stories with more quoted speech and temporal and spatial expressions. In addition, the children listened to Sam's stories carefully, assisting her and giving suggestions on how to improve them. With Sam, children not only learned new linguistic behaviors that are important for literacy, but also to become critical listeners of other's stories.","Long

These are part of an ongoing research program, which is investigating the usefulness of the technological mediated collaborative problem solving for distance learning. Technological mediation consists of access to shared simulations and access to a variety of means of communication. The means of communication we have explored range from audio only contact to video mediated communication with or without eye contact. The motivating question behind this research program is ‘what is different when members of a problem-solving group are physically separated but technologically connected?’ The studies are set in the context of pairs of adults working with shared simulations of either physics or statistical experiments. The first set of studies investigated pairs working on a shared simulation of a physics experiment developed in SharedARK. The study compared remote technological mediated communication with communication that occurred during physical co-presence. There were no differences in performance, but the addition of computer mediated communication did influence the pattern of interaction. These experiments suggested that eye contact influenced problem solving. The second set of studies compared pairs and groups of threes and fours using a simulation of a statistic experiment developed in a system called Kansas. In these studies we compared learners with either video-mediated communication or audio only communication. The addition of the visual communication channel altered the pattern of interaction. The most recent study presents evidence that suggests eye contact facilitated conceptual understanding..","Long

Effects of Content Schemes and Cooperation Scripts in Peer Teaching Settings","Video-conferencing is expected to become increasingly important for tele-learning environments. In contrast to asynchronous, text-based computer-mediated communication, video-conferencing facilitates cooperation tasks that require highly frequent and continuous coordination. Typical kinds of such cooperation tasks are found in peer teaching settings. Despite the growing application of video-conferencing, only little is known about possibilities of enhancing collaboration in video-conferencing settings. This study investigates the effects of different types of support for cooperation on the learning outcomes of peer dyads in a video-conferencing scenario. The main research question is how cooperation scripts and content schemes enhance the students’ cognitive activities and foster the outcomes of cooperative learning. Two factors were varied experimentally: The content scheme (with/without) and the cooperation script (with/without). 86 university students of educational psychology participated in the study. Each student of a dyad received a text dealing with a psychological theory in the field of the nature-nurture-debate. The students’ tasks were (1) to teach their partners the relevant contents of their text and (2) to reflect ideas that went beyond the scope of the text. Results indicate that in particular the cooperation script enhances learning outcomes of collaborative knowledge construction.","Long

We are interested to find out how, within a computer environment, students collaborate, how they use the different tools we offer and how this influences the quality of the final product. A custom-made computer-supported environment (TC3) was implemented that enables pairs of high school students to collaborate in writing an argumentative essay. The essay had to be convincing and based on authentic information sources. TC3, a groupware program, offers the students as task related and communicative tools: a shared text editor, a chat facility, access to relevant sources of information and a private notepad. Furthermore, some facilities or tools were offered that might promote collaboration on the task: access to the chat history, adaptability of the display layout, marking and searching in information sources and counting the number of words in the shared text. From our analyses we may conclude that the tools and resources the students use during collaborative writing seem to reflect the writing strategies they adhere to and that the use of these tools and resources in the different phases of the collaborative writing process is related to the argumentative quality of the final product. Future research will focus on the effects of adding tools for text planning and linearization to the TC3 environment on the coordination processes of collaborative writing.","Long

The technical part of Livenotes is a collaborative whiteboard running on wireless handheld computers. We describe the system and the affordances we have developed for it to support the distributed dialogue model. We then examine the interactive dialogue that resulted from two classroom trials, using transcript captures, and analyze how users developed ways to navigate between pages, organize space on screens, determine whether the system was operational, and create social rapport.

Examples of these dialogues show dozens of turns (individual utterances by participants) in a single learning session. In contrast, measurements of interaction from computer-supported collaborative learning environments show that on-line dialogue looks much different, with an average of approximately one posting or less per student per week. Measurements of learning in these environments do suggest learning is occurring, but presumably, not based on the same kind of dialogue described in research on face-to-face collaboration. We explore explanations for how the learning is arising in CSCL environments based on the Vicarious Learning Project (Lee, Dineen, McKendree, & Mayes, 1999; McKendree, Stenning, Mayes, Lee, & Cox, 1998), but in the course of this explanation, two additional hypotheses emerge. We believe that some of the learning in CSCL environments occurs from the observation of the dialogue, the reflection induced by the potential of submitting, and in the interaction between the face-to-face and on-line environments.","Long

We describe a study comparing the use of two systems, WebAnn and EPost, to support class discussion of technical papers in a graduate course. WebAnn is a shared annotation system that supports anchored discussions on web pages, and allows users to easily associate comments with a particular paragraph, phrase, or word in the paper being discussed. EPost is a high-quality conventional discussion board system. In our study, students contributed almost twice as much to the online discussion using WebAnn.

The investigators analyzed the content of the students' and teachers' communication in the web-based environment.

Authority, a major force in the classroom, gives certain people, objects, representations or ideas the power to affect thought and behavior and influences communication and interaction. Effective computer-supported collaborative learning requires students and teachers to change how they understand and assign authority. This paper describes two studies in which students’ perceptions of authority led to learning difficulties while they were engaged in collaborative learning. Students converged on either a representation or representational style that they believed was authoritative instead of basing their choice on how well the available representations communicated a concept. Methods to help students avoid such premature convergence are suggested.","Long Papers","teacher,student,established,social,role,norm,convention,encounter,computer-supported,collaborative,learning,cscl,system,classroom,authority,major,force,classroom,give,certain,people,object,representation,idea,power,affect,thought,behavior,influence,communication,interaction,effective,computer-supported,collaborative,learning,requires,student,teacher,change,understand,assign,authority,paper,describes,two,study,student,’,perception,authority,led,learning,difficulty,engaged,collaborative,learning,student,converged,either,representation,representational,style,believed,authoritative,instead,basing,choice,well,available,representation,communicated,concept,method,help,student,avoid,premature,convergence,suggested","teacher student,student established,established social,social role,role norm,norm convention,convention encounter,encounter computer-supported,computer-supported collaborative,collaborative learning,learning cscl,cscl system,system classroom,classroom authority,authority major,major force,force classroom,classroom give,give certain,certain people,people object,object representation,representation idea,idea power,power affect,affect thought,thought behavior,behavior influence,influence communication,communication interaction,interaction effective,effective computer-supported,computer-supported collaborative,collaborative learning,learning requires,requires student,student teacher,teacher change,change understand,understand assign,assign authority,authority paper,paper describes,describes two,two study,study student,student ’,’ perception,perception authority,authority led,led learning,learning difficulty,difficulty engaged,engaged collaborative,collaborative learning,learning student,student converged,converged either,either representation,representation representational,representational style,style believed,believed authoritative,authoritative instead,instead basing,basing choice,choice well,well available,available representation,representation communicated,communicated concept,concept method,method help,help student,student avoid,avoid premature,premature convergence,convergence suggested","teacher student established,student established social,established social role,social role norm,role norm convention,norm convention encounter,convention encounter computer-supported,encounter computer-supported collaborative,computer-supported collaborative learning,collaborative learning cscl,learning cscl system,cscl system classroom,system classroom authority,classroom authority major,authority major force,major force classroom,force classroom give,classroom give certain,give certain people,certain people object,people object representation,object representation idea,representation idea power,idea power affect,power affect thought,affect thought behavior,thought behavior influence,behavior influence communication,influence communication interaction,communication interaction effective,interaction effective computer-supported,effective computer-supported collaborative,computer-supported collaborative learning,collaborative learning requires,learning requires student,requires student teacher,student teacher change,teacher change understand,change understand assign,understand assign authority,assign authority paper,authority paper describes,paper describes two,describes two study,two study student,study student ’,student ’ perception,’ perception authority,perception authority led,authority led learning,led learning difficulty,learning difficulty engaged,difficulty engaged collaborative,engaged collaborative learning,collaborative learning student,learning student converged,student converged either,converged either representation,either representation representational,representation representational style,representational style believed,style believed authoritative,believed authoritative instead,authoritative instead basing,instead basing choice,basing choice well,choice well available,well available representation,available representation communicated,representation communicated concept,communicated concept method,concept method help,method help student,help student avoid,student avoid premature,avoid premature convergence,premature convergence suggested"

In addition to domain knowledge, models can contain information about learners’ knowledge profiles and social aspects of learning. This paper explores different ways to interact with models in order to support reflection, negotiated assessment, and knowledge awareness.

The paper presents a principled approach to the design of problem-oriented, web-based learning at the university level. The principles include providing authentic contexts with multimedia, supporting collaborative knowledge construction, making thinking visible with dynamic visualization, quick access to content resources via Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), and flexible support by tele-tutoring. These principles are used in the Munich Net-based Learning In Computer Science (MUNICS) learning environment, which is designed to support students of computer science to apply their factual knowledge from the lectures to complex real-world problems. For example, students can model the knowledge management in an educational organization with a graphical simulation tool. Some more general findings from a formative evaluation study with the MUNICS prototype are reported and discussed. E.g., the students’ ignorance of the additional content resources is discussed in the light of the well-known finding of insufficient use of help systems in software applications.","Short

This paper addresses the application part of transfer. For novice problem solvers, applying cases can be a difficult task. Case-based Reasoning (Kolodner, 1993; Schank, 1982) makes some suggestions for promoting good case application. Learning By Design (LBD) (Kolodner et al., 1998) builds on case-based reasoning and constructivist approaches to learning as well as classroom practices from problem based learning and communities of learners, to support both collaborative learning and learning from hands-on activities (Kolodner & Nagel, 1999). The software component to LBD, SMILE (Supportive Multi-User Interactive Learning Environment), was designed to promote the kinds of reflection that case-based reasoning suggests are needed to learn from experience. Among other tools, SMILE consisted of a Case Authoring Tool, whose role was to scaffold student’s reading of an expert case such that they could write it up to present to the rest of the class. Although this tool did approach students’ understanding of an expert case, it did not approach students’ application of that case to their challenge. This paper reports on the Case Application Tool Suite (CATS), which supports four stages of case application – case interpretation, matching, solution application, and solution assessment. This tool suite builds on our experiences with scaffolding design discussions (with the Design Discussion Area (DDA)) and scaffolds both case application and collaborative learning in a project-based environment.","Short

The objective of this framework is to help tutors achieve better results from group discussions and improve knowledge transfer among the participants. The overall idea is to organize the group discussion in an argumentation tree and involve the participants in successive discussion activities. The coordination of the discussion is made by a set of intelligent mechanisms which reason over the discussion and propose new interactions among the participants. AMANDA advances the discussion by generating progressive discussion cycles until a desired set of target conditions are observed. At each discussion cycle, the system redistributes discussion tasks among the participants to ensure a desired degree of agreement and participation among them.

SNS has been designed to facilitate the implementation of a learning community, wherein members (teachers, students, parents, etc.) have tools for representing, organizing, sharing and collaborating on their thoughts and efforts. The SNS environment may be installed locally for the learning community whether that is a school building, school district or consortium of teachers or schools collaborating on implementing a cross schools project. SNS is being provided for free, has an Application Programming Interface (API) so others can develop applications for it, and is open source so that everyone can participate in enhancing and supporting it. SNS includes tools such as secure login, well-defined user roles and group types, file system, calendar & task manager, chat & discussion boards, notes & document creator, and homework notification. The system’s strength and potential for longevity lie in its Open Source (GNU Public License) development model, object and process oriented operating environment, and a robust application programming interface (API). Many schools (internationally) have downloaded SNS for trials and a number are currently engaged in pilot programs.","Short

Knowledge building discourse in the Fle2 type of systems usually leads to gradual accumulation of notes. We have found that users experience difficulties to get an overall picture of the knowledge produced and synthesize its advancement. By providing means for the participants to highlight key ideas, that they find particularly useful, the CoDi tool was designed to facilitate collective management of knowledge and inquiry and provide various visual representations of the database. We report results of a pilot experiment carried out with the CoDi prototype that appears to be a promising tool. However there are certain open questions concerning what are the social and pedagogical effects of highlighting ideas in different educational setting, how highlighting should be organized so that it would provide strongest support of knowledge advancement, and whether the results should always be shared not only by tutors but also by students. Regardless of the challenges, the development of the CoDi tool appears to open up an interesting line of inquiry that we would like to share with the CSCL community.","Short

Technical help with programming problems was by far the most prominent type of help given or received. The frequency of helping interactions not only increased over the course of two design projects but also became more varied. Distribution of helping interactions became only more equitable in a second design project.

Collaborative review and assessment involves the student, their peers and tutor in thoughtful and critical examination of each student’s course work. The process involves two stages: review and discussion of the student’s work with a view to bringing different critical yet supportive perspectives to the work. This is followed by the use of two sets of criteria to make judgements on the student’s work: one set provided by the student, the other by the tutor. The purpose of collaborative assessment is to foster a learning approach to assessment and to develop a shared power relationship with students. From analysis of face to face interviews, examination of e-learning discussions and student completed questionnaires, a set of analytic categories was developed describing the learners’ experiences of collaborative assessment. The paper focuses on analysing and discussing these categories of experience. The research shows that collaborative e-learning assessment helps students move away from dependence on lecturers as the only or major source of judgement about the quality of learning. Students develop skill and know how about self and peer assessment and see themselves as competent in making judgements about their own and each other’s work, which are good lifelong learning skills.","Short

Our study focused on survey and case study data that SRI International collected as part of its ongoing evaluation of GLOBE (Means et al., 2001). We hypothesized: (1) teachers who are active in implementing an inquiry-based science program more frequently employ collaboration for cognitively complex activities than teachers who are less active implementers; (2) active teachers use collaboration more over time; and, (3) active GLOBE teachers who organize learning by collaborative groups perceive greater learning benefits than active teachers who rarely used collaboration. Our study confirmed that active teachers of an inquiry-based science program use collaboration more over time, but they are no more likely than less active teachers to see collaboration as beneficial to student learning. We also found that active teachers were likely to use collaborative small groups primarily to support data collection and reporting tasks to make them fit better into the classroom schedule than for data analysis and interpretation.","Short

We previously observed that MUD users rely on spatial positions to refine the conversational context and thereby facilitate mutual understanding. Supporting mutual understanding is a main challenge of CSCL research. We explore how this may happen in a continuous 3D space (VRML). Our first hypothesis was that the proximity of the emitter to the referred object clarifies the referential context. Our second hypothesis stated that the receiver uses gaze awareness in order to guess which object the emitter refers to. The experiment results confirmed the first hypothesis, surprisingly rejected the second hypothesis and reveal complex interactions between the two.","Short Papers","contribution,investigates,role,virtual,space,social,interaction,collaborative,task,previously,observed,mud,user,rely,spatial,position,refine,conversational,context,thereby,facilitate,mutual,understanding,supporting,mutual,understanding,main,challenge,cscl,research,explore,may,happen,continuous,3d,space,vrml,first,hypothesis,proximity,emitter,referred,object,clarifies,referential,context,second,hypothesis,stated,receiver,us,gaze,awareness,order,guess,object,emitter,refers,experiment,result,confirmed,first,hypothesis,surprisingly,rejected,second,hypothesis,reveal,complex,interaction,two","contribution investigates,investigates role,role virtual,virtual space,space social,social interaction,interaction collaborative,collaborative task,task previously,previously observed,observed mud,mud user,user rely,rely spatial,spatial position,position refine,refine conversational,conversational context,context thereby,thereby facilitate,facilitate mutual,mutual understanding,understanding supporting,supporting mutual,mutual understanding,understanding main,main challenge,challenge cscl,cscl research,research explore,explore may,may happen,happen continuous,continuous 3d,3d space,space vrml,vrml first,first hypothesis,hypothesis proximity,proximity emitter,emitter referred,referred object,object clarifies,clarifies referential,referential context,context second,second hypothesis,hypothesis stated,stated receiver,receiver us,us gaze,gaze awareness,awareness order,order guess,guess object,object emitter,emitter refers,refers experiment,experiment result,result confirmed,confirmed first,first hypothesis,hypothesis surprisingly,surprisingly rejected,rejected second,second hypothesis,hypothesis reveal,reveal complex,complex interaction,interaction two","contribution investigates role,investigates role virtual,role virtual space,virtual space social,space social interaction,social interaction collaborative,interaction collaborative task,collaborative task previously,task previously observed,previously observed mud,observed mud user,mud user rely,user rely spatial,rely spatial position,spatial position refine,position refine conversational,refine conversational context,conversational context thereby,context thereby facilitate,thereby facilitate mutual,facilitate mutual understanding,mutual understanding supporting,understanding supporting mutual,supporting mutual understanding,mutual understanding main,understanding main challenge,main challenge cscl,challenge cscl research,cscl research explore,research explore may,explore may happen,may happen continuous,happen continuous 3d,continuous 3d space,3d space vrml,space vrml first,vrml first hypothesis,first hypothesis proximity,hypothesis proximity emitter,proximity emitter referred,emitter referred object,referred object clarifies,object clarifies referential,clarifies referential context,referential context second,context second hypothesis,second hypothesis stated,hypothesis stated receiver,stated receiver us,receiver us gaze,us gaze awareness,gaze awareness order,awareness order guess,order guess object,guess object emitter,object emitter refers,emitter refers experiment,refers experiment result,experiment result confirmed,result confirmed first,confirmed first hypothesis,first hypothesis surprisingly,hypothesis surprisingly rejected,surprisingly rejected second,rejected second hypothesis,second hypothesis reveal,hypothesis reveal complex,reveal complex interaction,complex interaction two"

A “webtank” (think tank on the web) is being developed to support think tank activities. Prior to implementing a webtank for BEACON, I initiated collaboration with the SETI Institute on their development of a high school integrated science curriculum (astronomy, geology, biology, and the evolution of technology) where students explore how the concept of evolution underpins and integrates these disciplines. Curriculum requirements for the final Evolution of Technology module provided an opportunity to develop, pilot, and test a self-organizing collaborative web environment, or webtank, to be later adapted, augmented, and extended to support BEACON.

These four contributions to CSCL are inter-related. The notion of collaborative knowledge building defines a useful paradigm for conceptualizing learning as social practice. The social interactions and knowledge management activities in which shared knowledge is constructed can be analyzed as the result of interweaving group and personal conversational perspectives. In general, collaborative interaction is mediated by artifacts: sometimes only by transitory artifacts like spoken words or gestures, but increasingly by physical or digital artifacts and media. Empirical studies of collaborative knowledge building employing micro-ethnographic analysis of speech, gesture, artifacts and media can make the details of these collaboration interactions visible, highlighting the interplay of perspectives and artifacts in the trans-personal construction of knowledge. A theoretical framework incorporating models of knowledge building, perspectives and artifacts – and grounded in empirical analysis of collaborative interaction – can guide the design of computer-based artifacts and media as support for collaborative learning with appropriate, elaborated and unified conceptualizations.","Long

Distributed collaborative learning is commonly placed in hybrid settings, where the participants engage in computer-mediated communication as part of some sort of institutionalized education. There are thus some inherent issues, both new and old, that need to be taken into consideration when doing ethnography in distributed learning environments. Addressing these issues, we emphasize the role of technology and information infrastructure and how this might impact the learning situation, but also how it can be used as a resource in ethnographic research. In addition, we discuss how to observe, participate and immerse oneself in these technologically dense environments. This includes presenting and exploring concepts such as virtual observations and technological immersion, but also discussing more common topics like access and the role of the researcher. Another important aspect of ethnographic studies is the devotion to an empirical grounding of the research, which again presents methodological challenges when studying students working online and in distributed settings.","Short

The goal of the study was to investigate how the students used a set of groupware tools to coordinate learning activities. We have used concepts from collaborative telelearning and coordination mechanisms (Schmidt & Simone, 1996) as analytic framework. Our findings indicate that students coordinate many activities by implicit, locally adopted resources instead of fully developed mechanisms. Three implicit resources were identified and named (no initial discussion, asymmetry of knowledge, and different expectations). These resources were not associated with any specific groupware features, but referred to the students’ background knowledge and subjective interpretation. We end the paper by suggesting how implicit resources in distributed learning environments can play a role similar to how non-verbal cues – such as gesture and facial expression – play a role in face-to-face interaction, but without imitating human body language.","Short Papers","analyzed,data,field,study,collaborative,telelearning,wasson,1999,goal,study,investigate,student,used,set,groupware,tool,coordinate,learning,activity,used,concept,collaborative,telelearning,coordination,mechanism,schmidt,simone,1996,analytic,framework,finding,indicate,student,coordinate,many,activity,implicit,locally,adopted,resource,instead,fully,developed,mechanism,three,implicit,resource,identified,named,initial,discussion,asymmetry,knowledge,different,expectation,resource,associated,specific,groupware,feature,referred,student,’,background,knowledge,subjective,interpretation,end,paper,suggesting,implicit,resource,distributed,learning,environment,play,role,similar,non-verbal,cue,–,gesture,facial,expression,–,play,role,face-to-face,interaction,without,imitating,human,body,language","analyzed data,data field,field study,study collaborative,collaborative telelearning,telelearning wasson,wasson 1999,1999 goal,goal study,study investigate,investigate student,student used,used set,set groupware,groupware tool,tool coordinate,coordinate learning,learning activity,activity used,used concept,concept collaborative,collaborative telelearning,telelearning coordination,coordination mechanism,mechanism schmidt,schmidt simone,simone 1996,1996 analytic,analytic framework,framework finding,finding indicate,indicate student,student coordinate,coordinate many,many activity,activity implicit,implicit locally,locally adopted,adopted resource,resource instead,instead fully,fully developed,developed mechanism,mechanism three,three implicit,implicit resource,resource identified,identified named,named initial,initial discussion,discussion asymmetry,asymmetry knowledge,knowledge different,different expectation,expectation resource,resource associated,associated specific,specific groupware,groupware feature,feature referred,referred student,student ’,’ background,background knowledge,knowledge subjective,subjective interpretation,interpretation end,end paper,paper suggesting,suggesting implicit,implicit resource,resource distributed,distributed learning,learning environment,environment play,play role,role similar,similar non-verbal,non-verbal cue,cue –,– gesture,gesture facial,facial expression,expression –,– play,play role,role face-to-face,face-to-face interaction,interaction without,without imitating,imitating human,human body,body language","analyzed data field,data field study,field study collaborative,study collaborative telelearning,collaborative telelearning wasson,telelearning wasson 1999,wasson 1999 goal,1999 goal study,goal study investigate,study investigate student,investigate student used,student used set,used set groupware,set groupware tool,groupware tool coordinate,tool coordinate learning,coordinate learning activity,learning activity used,activity used concept,used concept collaborative,concept collaborative telelearning,collaborative telelearning coordination,telelearning coordination mechanism,coordination mechanism schmidt,mechanism schmidt simone,schmidt simone 1996,simone 1996 analytic,1996 analytic framework,analytic framework finding,framework finding indicate,finding indicate student,indicate student coordinate,student coordinate many,coordinate many activity,many activity implicit,activity implicit locally,implicit locally adopted,locally adopted resource,adopted resource instead,resource instead fully,instead fully developed,fully developed mechanism,developed mechanism three,mechanism three implicit,three implicit resource,implicit resource identified,resource identified named,identified named initial,named initial discussion,initial discussion asymmetry,discussion asymmetry knowledge,asymmetry knowledge different,knowledge different expectation,different expectation resource,expectation resource associated,resource associated specific,associated specific groupware,specific groupware feature,groupware feature referred,feature referred student,referred student ’,student ’ background,’ background knowledge,background knowledge subjective,knowledge subjective interpretation,subjective interpretation end,interpretation end paper,end paper suggesting,paper suggesting implicit,suggesting implicit resource,implicit resource distributed,resource distributed learning,distributed learning environment,learning environment play,environment play role,play role similar,role similar non-verbal,similar non-verbal cue,non-verbal cue –,cue – gesture,– gesture facial,gesture facial expression,facial expression –,expression – play,– play role,play role face-to-face,role face-to-face interaction,face-to-face interaction without,interaction without imitating,without imitating human,imitating human body,human body language"

Having taught online at another university, she had joined this program because of her interest in pursuing online teaching in more depth in an institution with impressive leadership that ‘wanted to grow.’ The 13- month program in which Pat teaches includes three face-to-face meetings of students and professors.

In collaborative design, the knowledge to understand, frame, and resolve problems does not exist, but is constructed and evolved during the process, exploiting the power of “symmetry of ignorance” and “breakdowns.” From this perspective, access to existing information and knowledge (often seen as the major advance of new media) is a very limiting concept. To illustrate this theoretical approach towards collaborative learning, the participants in this interactive event will engage in collaborative design activities supported by the Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory (EDC). The EDC merges physical interaction, handheld devices, simulations, end-user modifiability, and evolving web spaces to support a) the integration of problem framing and problem solving, b) the creation of shared understanding articulated as externalizations, and c) computer-supported learning among stakeholders. We will design the interactive event such that the participants will form a community of interest (defined by their collective concern with the resolution of a design problem) as they take on the roles of stakeholders from various communities of practice (such as city planners, transportation designers, and citizens). The event will illustrate the possibilities and limitations of the EDC for providing unique and innovative computer support for collaborative learning.","Interactive

A NLS is tentatively defined as a program or set of programs designed to operate over a network and support users as they undertake tasks or participate in processes related to learning. CSCL is one type, albeit an important one, of process that can be enabled by NLS. This interactive event is intended to help participants build a shared language to facilitate discussions related to NLS. Through participation in a series of online and face-to-face activities, participants will build knowledge of many networked learning systems currently available, identify important dimensions of these systems, understand what aspects of those dimensions are important and why, and develop an understanding of how the work they are doing relates to the field of NLS. Participants in this session will undertake the online activities within the Shadow netWorkspace™ (SNS) (http://sns.internetschools.org), a NLS being developed by the Center for Technology Innovation in Education at the University of Missouri-Columbia.","Interactive

The theoretical framework is found within socio-cultural perspectives that view learning as socially and culturally constructed and of which artefacts are considered as inseparable from human activity. In agreement with the intellectual heritage, the collaboration patterns are identified through analyses of various extracts of dialogues and actions taken place between the students and how these extracts are operationalised by available artefacts.

Usually analysis of collaborative problem solving situations is done through discourse analysis or interaction analysis, where in the center of attention are the actors involved (students, tutors etc.). An alternative framework, called “Object-oriented Collaboration Analysis Framework (OCAF)” is presented here, according to which the objects of the collaboratively developed solution become the center of attention and are studied as entities that carry their own history. This approach produces a view of the process, according to which the solution is made of structural components that are ‘owned’ by actors who have contributed in various degrees to their development. OCAF is based on both actions and dialogues of actors, providing qualitative as well as quantitative indicators of collaboration and solution quality. The paper presents first the framework notation. Examples of its use in analysis of distance groups and face-to-face collaborative activities are provided next, followed by the dimensions of the framework supported analysis for teachers and researchers. Web-based tools supporting the OCAF approach are also presented.","Long
