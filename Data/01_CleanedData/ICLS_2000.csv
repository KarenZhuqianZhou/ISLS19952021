H.||Horwitz, Paul||Christie, Mary Ann","Integrating Instruction, Assessment, & Evaluation in a Technology-Based Genetics Environment: The GenScope(TM) Follow-up Study","A previously reported study in 24 secondary science classrooms showed the GenScope computer-supported learning environment to be at least as effective as conventional curricula at enhancing genetics reasoning ability. A follow-up study in three more classrooms yielded the dramatic reasoning gains we had been seeking, partly by addressing four unresolved issues from the prior research. First, addressing previous difficulties implementing GenScope in shared computer labs, the follow-up study used laptop computers installed in the biology classroom. Second, addressing problems establishing valid comparison classrooms, we established a more valid comparison classroom that did not encounter ""carry over"" from the GenScope classrooms. The third issue concerned continuing refinements made to the GenScope curriculum. The final issue concerned one aspect of that curriculum, formative assessments that used the familiar GenScope dragons to scaffold reasoning targeted in our summative assessments. By withholding these activities from one of two GenScope classrooms, the present study confirmed that this enhancement to ""systemic"" validity (Frederiksen & Collins, 1989) presented a small, acceptable degree of compromise to ""evidential"" validity. The specific results and the broader collaboration are considered in light of recent federal policy reports regarding educational technology, educational research, and assessment

Significant differences were found both at the conceptual level and at the level of basic epistemological and ontological presuppositions and beliefs. It is suggested that helping students understand and use complex systems knowledge will require helping students construct a richer conceptual ecology which embraces both non-reductive and decentralized thinking, multiple causality, non-linearity, randomness, and so on.

The model has been developed in an empirical study where we examined the quality of asynchronous interaction in web-based conferencing. Because all successful communication presumes perspective-taking skills and reciprocal understanding among the participants, we studied whether the students are able to reach in reciprocal interaction and thus create educationally relevant high-level web-based discussion. The subjects of the study are pre-service teachers in the USA (N=40) and Finland (N=30) who use an asynchronous web-based tool called Conferencing on the Web (COW) to collaborate in creating joint case-based descriptions in different areas of teaching and learning. The results of the study point out different levels of web-based discussion. More specific analysis of the quality of each discussion level focused on perspective taking in communication. The results support our hypothesis that higher level perspective taking was related to higher level discussion. The relevancy of perspective-taking theory as a tool for analysing web-based discussion is discussed.","cognition","unknown","http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Jarvela.pdf","web-based

We explore two key issues: teachers' beliefs about the functionality of the tool, and ways in which teachers customize it to support inquiry-based learning. Using interview data and software artifacts, the study explored some of the striking similarities and differences in beliefs and tool customization across three teachers engaged in the same instructional unit. Findings provide evidence for an initial category scheme of tool functions perceived by teachers to meet both teacher needs and student needs in scientific investigations. Additionally, teachers' customized Portfolio templates revealed a continuum of general-purpose to task-specific designs to scaffold student inquiry within or across science units. Implications for future research are discussed in light of these results, including a need to expand on the existing belief category scheme and customization examples, and a need to do longitudinal research that will shed more light on changing beliefs and use as a result of experience.","cognition","unknown","http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Matese.pdf","teacher beliefs and

The system is enriched with the mutual linking capability that requires the learners to explicitly think about and comment on relationships between two pieces of information. In a course on human problem solving the students first studied and reported some classical problem solving literature. The students are then asked to make relations among their presentations by utilizing ReCoNote's mutual linking function, and report to the class the linkages they made. In the third phase, a report on the characteristics of humans as problem-solving systems was required as the summary activity. The log data analyses reveal that the students visited other groups' notes often and as the course develops, links spread from within one's own group's notes to cover notes created by other members belonging to other study topics. Students who actively used the system tended to turn in high-quality summaries. The system has been used in three half-year classes and the initial analyses of the activities have revealed that this mutual linking did in fact help the learners learn rather complicated topics in

Teachers need to learn new methods and content to enact reform-based curriculum. Educative curriculum material designed to address teacher learning as well as student, is one potential vehicle. Our work is embedded in an ongoing urban systemic initiative of a large public school district to reform science education. As part of this effort, science curriculum materials were developed that were consistent with constructivist ideas, addressed national and local goals for student learning and educative for teachers. Three middle-school teachers with limited experience with physics and project-based science enacted a 10 week, force and motion unit using educative curriculum materials. Classes were videotaped daily and teachers were interviewed periodically throughout the unit. Through qualitative analysis across data sources we found teachers used and learned from educative features in the materials. In addition, educative features addressing pedagogical content knowledge were used more often and more effectively than those that addressed either pedagogical or content knowledge. Our work indicates educative curriculum can facilitate teacher learning necessary for improved practice and informs development of materials for all teachers as well as those participating in urban reform.","cognition","unknown","http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Schneider.pdf","professional development, curriculum, science education, educational

Existing models of procedural acquisition fail to distinguish between levels of ""skilled"" performance. In particular, there is some evidence that automaticity may not be the only endpoint in the acquisition of a skill. Issues of expertise, automaticity, and competency are explored in a case study of a 8th grader in the domain of algebra equation solving. Multiple levels of competence, leading to expertise, are described.

18,18,"Star, Jon R.","On the Relationship Between Knowing and Doing in Procedural Learning","The relationship between learners' knowledge of concepts and their ability to execute procedural skills is an important issue that has been explored in several different fields in cognitive science. A review of some of the existing literature within the domain of mathematics learning indicates that little useful theory has been developed to explain how conceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge are related. A primary reason for this deficiency is that knowledge of concepts is treated as a multi-faceted and rich construct, while procedural knowledge is very narrowly defined and operationalized. Philosophical and historical foundations for this differential treatment are discussed. It is suggested that distinguishing between knowledge type and depth of knowledge illuminates alternative ways in which procedural knowledge can be known and understood.

The main outcome of the study is an analytical distinction between instruction as (""crystallized"") artifact-bound representations and ""live"" or situated instructions.

This study examines a set of such models constructed during a high school investigation of a local creek. Affordances for the demonstration of conceptual, epistemological and strategic understandings were identified before searching for these understandings in the models. The computer models as a set represent a substantial portion (70%) of the scientific content in the creek project. Ecological content was most strongly represented in the models and most students were able to model causal linkages between biology, earth science, physical science and/or environmental science phenomena. The models potentially represent a much smaller proportion of the epistemological and strategic content of the project. However, these understandings were more tightly scaffolded by the task, so most of the models showed evidence of these types of understandings. Analysis of the content in the models provides evidence of the veracity of students' understandings. Students demonstrated more understandings around specific content than they did about the strategic or epistemological understandings of

26,26,"Wu, Hsin-kai||Krajcik, Joseph S.||Soloway, Elliot","Using Technology to Support the Development of Conceptual Understanding of Chemical Representations","Many students have difficulty learning symbolic and molecular chemical representations. This study investigates how students develop their understanding of chemical representations with the aid of a visualizing tool, eChem, that allows them to build molecular models and view multiple representations simultaneously. Multiple sources of data were collected with the participation of 71 eleventh graders in a high school over a six-week period. The results of the pre- and post-tests show that students' understanding of chemical representations improved substantially (t=13.9, p<.001, effect size= 2.68). The analysis of video recordings reveals that several features in eChem helped students construct models and translate representations. Evidence also shows that high engagement students' discussions involved both visual and conceptual aspects of representations, which in turn may deepened their understandings of representations. Moreover, the findings suggest that models can serve as a vehicle for students to generate mental images, and that different types of 3D models were not used interchangeably for these students.","cognition","unknown","http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Wu.pdf","visualization, science education, high

Interviews prior to the course identified a range of student alternative frameworks regarding the composition and mechanics of the Solar System. During the course, student groups constructed three 3-D models of increasing complexity representing different aspects of the Solar System. Students explored these models in a 3-D virtual environment and posted their final projects on the course World Wide Web page. Post interviews were targeted toward quantitative and qualitative assessment of student conceptual growth. Students showed significant improvement in their conceptual understanding concerning the phases and eclipses of the Moon and reasons for the seasons.

We focus briefly on how the tool has evolved through several years of iterative refinement, how the tool has been used by students in different curricular contexts for different epistemic practices, and how we as researchers can learn about students' learning and cognition through use of the affordances of such software environments. In particular, scaffolding in the form of prompts and hints are investigated for supporting causal explanations of scientific evidence (or argumentation) and promoting more general reflection. The results imply that both kinds of scaffolds support students' knowledge integration in important ways. The paper concludes with the claim that the guidance software helps students identify ways to improve their understanding by helping students think individually and collaboratively to provide alternative examples, thought experiments, and counter-evidence for consideration, and by providing a place to make their own thinking about these ideas visible and explicit. The paper also makes the broader claim that educational design studies such as the two reported here serve a unique role in identifying designed approaches that best support student learning while also informing our understanding of individual and social cognition in typical educational contexts.","design","unknown","http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Bell.pdf","learning

To evaluate Artemis, we conducted in-situ videotaped sessions with students using Artemis in a project-based curriculum. We supplemented this with analysis of log file data collected at the server level. Analysis of videotaped sessions show that students spend a considerable percentage of their in Artemis evaluating search results on a number of levels. Log files show that students also developed fairly sophisticated search strategies, using both browsing and searching, and constructing multiple-keyword searches.

The classical view of individual selection stresses the importance of competition between individuals for resources and survival. On this view, altruistic and cooperative behavior appear to be disadvantageous for evolutionary success. However, looking at evolution as a complex system, altruism and cooperation can be seen as valuable traits for individual survival. The EACH project developed hands-on materials that enabled students to engage and test their intuitions about the fitness and evolutionary success of altruistic behavior. The primary materials consisted of a set of multi-agent models (written in StarLogoT) and associated activities that guided students in exploring evolutionary scenarios. Through their involvement in the EACH project, many students who had started with an understanding of evolutionary fitness as a trait of isolated individuals came to appreciate the complexity of environmental and social factors in the evolutionary process.","design","unknown","http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Centola.pdf","science education, modeling/models, learning

A Virtual Homework Center (VHC) is invented for high school students to carry out computer-supported collaborative problem-solving activities in the home environment. VHC gives great importance to interests and preferences of participants. Students can choose a subject or topic in which they are interested, they can invite people of whom they are fond, or join the group with which they feel comfortable. They can set their group work in either collaborative or competitive mode, depending on the preferences of participants. VHC aims at optimizing some of the important conditions for efficient network-based collaboration in the home environment: (a) supports students' self-initiated collaborative problem-solving activities, (b) embeds rich, yet natural, interactions within the system, (c) enables participants to create groups for collaborative work along with a set of collaboration parameters, (d) accounts for the action of each individual and the state of the collaboration in relation to the goal of tasks and, (d) promotes collaborative problem-solving and dialogue among participants in real-time. The main driving element of the collaboration within VHC is to bring the group into a state where a common answer is agreed upon. When this happens, convergence has been attained and the group has reached their collaborative goal.","design","unknown","http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Chen.pdf","home schooling,

In this paper we look at how a CoWeb ­ an unstructured collaboration space ­ was used to support a large college design class. Although the CoWeb was used for several purposes, we focus specifically on how it was used to support class discussions. We start with why we feel CoWeb discussions, and more generally online peer interaction, may be useful in light of our pedagogical goals. We then analyze the structure of the discussions and how students perceived them, and discuss how the online environment may have influenced behavior. From this analysis, we conclude the CoWeb was effective in helping students think about open-ended issues through online peer interaction.

To alleviate these problems we have introduced an innovative teaching/learning approach that employs a combination of virtual and physical models in an organic high school chemistry curriculum. We studied the effect of this approach on enhancing meaningful learning in chemistry. Experimental group students were more capable of defining and implementing new concepts in organic chemistry than their control group counterparts. When required to explain their answers, most of the experimental group students used mainly sketches of ball-and-stick models and some space-filling models.

Hari","On the Role of Animated Analogies in Algorithm Visualizations","If a ""picture is worth a thousand words,"" then why have attempts over the past decade to use pictures and animations to replace or supplement traditional instructional methods for teaching algorithms produced such disappointing results? In an earlier paper (Hansen, Schrimpsher, & Narayanan, 1998) we described a research project based on the premise that a rethinking of algorithm animation design is required in order to harness its power to enhance learning. The key insight was that for algorithm animations to be effective, they had to be ""chunked"" and embedded within a context and knowledge providing hypermedia information environment. In this paper, we report on ablation studies which were designed to discover which aspects of the prototype hypermedia visualization system that was developed (called HalVis) contributed to student learning. These preliminary studies led to a surprising discovery that interactive and animated analogies appear to significantly prime learning about abstract and dynamic algorithm behaviors from subsequent visualizations. We first present the interactive features and learning modules of HalVis. Two ablation experiments conducted on HalVis are then described. This is followed by a discussion of the results, their implications and how these are shaping our future research.","design","unknown","http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Hansen.pdf","visualization, learning environments, quantitative assessment, and cognitive

Teachers find it hard to help students learn content at the same time they are learning skills and processes required for inquiry and design. As well, many students need time to adapt to a classroom situation in which they must take initiative. In response to this need, we've created a ""launcher unit"" for our LBD classrooms called Apollo 13. Students watch a movie where they see scientists and engineers engaging in collaboration, communication, informed decision making, inquiry, and design, and then they engage in a series of short activities that focus on learning these complex skills. The activities provide an anchor for the rest of the year's activities in science class.

We identify two key difficulties. Firstly, neither learners nor tutors, who are used to more traditional methods of teaching, know exactly what to expect from PBL or how to behave appropriately within their new roles. Secondly, these problems are compounded by having to interact within a socially unfamiliar computer-based learning environment. We frame these difficulties in terms of schema theory which suggests that people behave and know what to expect from situations according to mentally represented scripts describing the typical course of events. We apply computational descriptions of these scripts, i.e. PBL-protocols, which guide and control social interaction in virtual PBL groups according to (a) the phase of the learning process and (b) the specific roles of tutor, learner and expert; three roles which are typically distinguished in the problem-based learning method. The PBL-protocols restrict the type of contributions allowed for each role type for each phase of the PBL learning process. We describe the implementation of the PBL-protocols in the CROCODILE virtual learning environment, and discuss results and implications of an early pilot study.","design","unknown","http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Miao.pdf","distributed learning environments,

Participatory Simulations Activities can support new forms of classroom interaction and can serve to catalyze the engagement with dynamic systems modeling as a core feature of the education of all students. To accomplish these goals, we introduce a new architecture, HubNet. HubNet is an open client-server architecture, which enables many users at the ""Nodes"" (currently TI graphing calculators) to control the behavior of individual objects or agents and to view the aggregated results on a central computer known as the Hub. This network of nodes is integrated with a powerful suite of modeling, analysis and display tools that together give users the capacity to ""fly"" the system in intuitive mode, to reflect on the emergent result of their simulation and, also, to encode their strategies as rules which the system can then run independently. The HubNet system is being used in several middle and secondary classrooms.

The issue is of more than historic interest in that a focus on this aspect of their positions not only reveals much about the two and their contributions to current thought but also provides a point of perspective for a more general reappraisal of the foundations of the learning sciences today. Habits, for Thorndike, could be divided into the instinctive and the acquired. Within his psychology, both types of habits consisted of predispositions to respond in particular ways to particular stimuli. Habits were a primary concern for Dewey, as well. Most day-to-day conduct, he believed, is ruled by habit. When disrupted, however, conduct comes under the influence of impulse and intelligence. Dewey introduced the term inquiry for the process by which intelligence recovers a situation that has in some way become problematic. Dewey's call for the inclusion of ""the social"" in psychology, was a call for a totally new approach to research into human learning and interaction. The implications for future work in educational research of adopting Dewey's approach are discussed.","socialcontext","unknown","http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Koschmann.pdf","social

69,69,"O'Neill, D. Kevin||Scardamalia, Marlene","Mentoring in the Open: A Strategy for Supporting Human Development in the Knowledge Society","On-line mentoring, or ""telementoring"" between K-12 students and adult volunteers has proven a valuable way to enable ambitious classroom inquiry. However, past research has shown that simply placing mentoring opportunities at the disposal of all students is not enough to make telementoring effective on an equitable basis. When mentoring relationships are conducted via private media like e-mail, the students who most need to see models of successful mentoring are, in fact, the least likely to encounter them. In the worst case this leads to a ""rich get richer"" dynamic, in which only students with previous experience of supportive learning partnerships are able to draw benefit from them. In design experiments conducted in Toronto-area high schools, we orchestrated telementoring relationships in a Knowledge Forum(TM) database � an asynchronous, electronic group workspace. In this new model of telementoring, students could (and did) ""peek"" into the telementoring dialogues of their peers. This ""opportunistic model-seeking"", as we call it, allowed students to develop more sophisticated ideas about the kinds of advice and guidance they wanted from their mentors, defeating the ""rich get richer"" dynamic. Our findings suggest that mentoring in the open may serve as a powerful component strategy for building equitable and sustainable on-line learning communities for participants of diverse age and

The problem addressed in the study was whether students representing different level of school achievement and gender would productively participate in progressive discourse. Technological infrastructure of the study was provided by the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Environments (CSILE) The study applied social network analysis to investigate written comments logged by 28 grade 5/6 students to CSILE's database. The study indicated that although the density of interactions within the CSILE class was rather high, there were large individual differences in regard to participation in CSILE-mediated discourse. Further, the analysis revealed that average- and high-achieving female students dominated discourse interaction within the CSILE class, and carried the main responsibility for all students' collaborative building of knowledge. An important characteristic of CSILE students' culture of interaction was that female and male students interacted mainly within their respective gender groups. Within the groups a significant amount of communication took place between students representing different achievement levels. It is concluded that social network analysis provided new information about patterns and structures of CSILE students' interaction culture that would have been very difficult to obtain by any other means.","socialcontext","unknown","http://websites.umich.edu/~icls/proceedings/pdf/Palonen.pdf","computer-mediated communication, discourse, learning environments, social

Teachers' task concerns had to do chiefly with the ambitious and open-ended nature of the task and whether students would have the necessary background conceptual knowledge and skills.

We examined the roles, functions and strategies that students, teachers, and mentors bring to complex on-line, project-based learning experiences. Data for our study consisted of site observations, interviews, student work samples and videotaped project presentations from twelve project-based mentoring relationships that were conducted entirely or partially on-line. We analyzed these data within the frameworks of mentoring, cognitive apprenticeship, and educational network interactions. Additionally, we introduced a web-based tool (Portals) to facilitate more effective communication in such mentoring situations and documented how and when it was used. We learned that mentors often take their cues from students about how to proceed in mentoring relationships and that they may not always be aware of the roles they play; and that teachers are important co-mentors in the process, particularly in creating cultures of collaboration in their classes and explicitly attending to and supporting students' communication skills. Technology was also an important player in these relationships.
