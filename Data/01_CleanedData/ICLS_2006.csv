Teachers completed surveys prior to training and after receiving training. Analysis compared the responses of beginning teachers (new to the process) and advanced teachers (receiving advanced training). Advanced teachers showed that their instructional strategies and goals corresponded to the innovations at the start. At the end of the training, Beginning teachers gave positive ratings for the training and their emotions toward implementing the training. Introduction Researchers have suggested that potential adopters' attitudes toward an innovation should be considered for it's diffusion (e.g., Ellsworth, 2000). However, few studies have examined how to address this (Ertmer, Conklin, Lewandowski, Osika, Selo, &amp; Wignall, 2003). This study investigated the extent to which a professional development training, one that regards teachers' attitudes and beliefs as being important elements to consider when designing professional development, may facilitate teachers' willingness to adopt instructional ideals and strategies of the innovation. The professional development training in this study was Great Expectations (GE) in Oklahoma. As a whole-school reform model, primary objectives of the training is to instruct teachers on ways to increase students' knowledge, self-esteem, and social competencies while also focusing on instructional strategies that align with constructivist principles. For example, similar to research on exemplary teachers (e.g., Allington &amp; Johnston, 2002), model GE teachers are exceptional classroom managers because they establish and explain routines/procedures and they emphasize student self-regulation. In a high-implementation GE classroom, disciplinary actions are rarely observed. Additionally, GE teachers use instructional strategies that emphasize cross-curricular, meaningful lessons in which cooperation and effort are emphasized. Also similar to exemplary teachers, GE teachers express high expectations for their students' learning and carefully monitor their students' understanding (Turner &amp; Shapley, 2000). Perhaps most importantly, teachers' implementation of GE practices has been shown to positively and significantly affect students' achievement (Biscoe &amp; Harris, 2005). To accomplish these overall objectives, GE focuses on the transformation of teachers through. Evaluation results have shown that teachers who fully implement GE (Turner &amp; Shapley, 2000) exhibit instructional and relational behaviors that have been described as ""exemplary"" in excellent teachers. By examining differences between teachers with and without experience of the GE training, this study investigated possible effects of the GE training, for example, addressing the question, ""To what extent might model professional development training impact teachers' attitudes, motivation, and willingness to implement the training?"" Methodology Participants were 158 teachers enrolled in a week-long GE summer institute. Of the participants, 97 were taking basic GE Methodology courses (beginning teachers), and 61 were taking advanced GE courses (advanced teachers). Prior to the beginning of the training, participants were asked to complete the following surveys: Incentives for Training (i.e., Self-Improvement, External Approval, Mandatory Pressure); Instructional Strategies (Mastery Approaches, Performance Approaches; from PALS, Midgely et al., 2000), and emotions for attending training (e.g., positive emotions and negative emotions). Following the training, participants completed an evaluation survey. The current analysis is part of a larger study that focuses on changes in teachers' attitudes and behaviors over time. Results First, there were significant differences between beginning teachers and advanced teachers with respect to their incentives for attending the training. Advanced teachers gave themselves higher ratings with respect to being motivated to attend the training by self-improvement (t=-2.389, p&lt;.05), while beginning teachers gave themselves higher ratings for attending the training because of mandatory pressure (t=-2.389,","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:03:56Z (GMT).

Model-based design may be as intellectually honest, culturally respectful, cognitively generative, and scientifically/mathematically authentic as learning that draws more directly on students' out-of-school resources.

Cognitive research on students' conceptual understandings has overly relied upon sequestered tasks and structured interviews; we argue that participant observation can provide insight into important particulars of everyday life to answer fundamental questions about the nature of children's learning of biology. These papers report on studies of the everyday cultural and social contexts in which children's informal ideas about the living world develop and are applied. The research employs a learner-centered focus and a cognitive ethnographic approach to explore children's knowledge as they utilize it in their homes, at school, and in an interactive science center. Research focuses on personally consequential biology topics including health, nutrition, and ecology. The papers report on the cultural experiences that shape children's biological knowledge and decision-making, similarities and differences between cultural groups, and implications for coordinating home and school experiences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:03:59Z (GMT).

However, to date, games have been chronically under-theorized a ""technology in search of a paradigm"" (Gredler, 1996). This symposium proposes new conceptualizations of games in relation to education. Our collective goal is to better articulate the nature of contemporary interactive technologies so as to forward educational theory; each paper addresses crucial aspects of games and gaming culture against a backdrop of research on learning, education, and society (c.f. Shaffer, Squire, Halverson, &amp; Gee, 2005; Steinkuehler, in press). To do so, this unique symposium combines (a) ethnographies of naturally occurring game environments, (b) game-based learning programs based on findings of how learning occurs in such environments (c) a an empirical model based on games for thought, a type of professional practice simulation games, and (d) a research project using games and game technologies for social science theorizing. Together, these papers suggest new directions for the cognitive sciences pointing toward how to design learning systems for an information age networked society.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:00Z (GMT).

Collaborative learning is the subject of study in a wide variety of disciplines such as developmental psychology (e.g., socio- cognitive conflict), social psychology (person perception, motivation, group processes), sociology (status, power and authority), cognitive psychology (how learning occurs, learning outcomes) and sociocultural perspectives (cultural influence on interaction, mediation of learning). These different perspectives suggest that a variety of methodological tools are needed to understand collaborative interactions. Each of the papers in this symposium explores one or more methods for examining the quality of collaborative interactions. The discussion will focus on criteria for good analyses of collaborative work as well as strengths and limitations of various methods.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:00Z (GMT).

The dyads without a shared workspace used more verbal co-ordination than both other groups. The dyads working with a shared workspace plus a content-specific graphical representation demonstrated better quality in their collaboratively written texts. The quality of this collaborative process resulted in better individual acquisition of important knowledge units. The study demonstrates that content-specific graphical representations make cooperative learning in videoconference-based learning settings more effective. The overall effects of a shared workspace were not so clear and should be further investigated.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It examines how individual studies contribute to theory development by using and extending an original theory of conceptual development, coordination class theory. We show how the diversity of contexts in which these ideas have been applied has contributed, not so much to validation, but to genuine expansion of meaning and power of the theory. This pattern emphasizes the essentially social nature of theory construction, and also a striking parallel between theory development in professional science and ideas about conceptual development in students that emphasize the role of multiple contexts. We discuss theoretical and methodological issues of communal development of a theory, such as theoretical power, fit, extension and generality.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:02Z (GMT).

In this interactive session, the handbook's four advisory board members and its editor, along with the session participants, will explore two sets of questions that were raised during the preparation of the CHLS, and which to some extent remain unresolved.

The three projects represented in this symposium focus on mathematical practices in the context of families. The first project takes an activity focus, examining mathematical practices in the context of a consequential context of family activity--money and its uses. The second project takes a topical focus, describing a wide range of practices in families that are seen as mathematical. The third paper focuses on a particular cultural group, attending to the meanings and uses of both informal and schooled mathematics in the family context. Together the papers provide a new perspective on qualities of mathematical practice outside of school and its actual, and potential, relations to school mathematics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:02Z (GMT).

In argumentative knowledge construction, learners collaboratively construct and engage in arguments with the goal of learning to argue within a domain. Students have difficulties, however, constructing and evaluating arguments. Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) attempts to address these difficulties by providing students with additional resources and tools to visualize and guide their argumentation. This symposium presents results from empirical studies on facilitating and analyzing argumentative knowledge construction in CSCL. These studies assess the structural and conceptual quality of learners' arguments; provide sequential analyses of how learners exchange arguments in discourse, and investigate the relationship between cognitive processes of learners and the construction of arguments in discourse.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:02Z (GMT).

Contexts for developing shared representations are those in which a class attempts to jointly construct one representational form to solve a given problem. In contrast, contexts for inventing unique representations emphasize individual representational choices with no explicit attempt to create a shared representational form. Drawing on and comparing data from two recent studies we use the Negotiated Representational Mediators (NeRM) framework to analyze young children's activities oriented towards the production, evaluation, and modification of representational forms. Both cultural contexts lead to a convergence toward normative representations as well as continuing to diverge in the form of individual acts of creativity and agency. We argue that despite these similar trends, the different contexts support unique aspects of representational practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:03Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Specifically, the intervention described merges privileged students from a private suburban high school (instructors) with inner-city youth from an impoverished neighborhood (learners) in a web-design course. The question for this research asks in what way do technology-experienced instructors bridge local understandings of technology learning to successfully engage technology-novice learners? Using a theoretical framework drawn from cultural sociology, this study examines the development of the instructors' technology fluency by bringing attention to the transformation of instructor schemas and practices as they interact with learners throughout the course. The intention is not only to illuminate the ""what and how"" of change but also to offer explanations as to why.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:03Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This goal proves to be a formidable challenge in domains, such as molecular genetics, for which the accumulated scientific understandings are daunting in both amount and complexity. To develop effective instruction that fosters generative reasoning we need to have a sound understanding of the types of knowledge in the domain that are critical for such reasoning. In this study I examined the ensemble of knowledge undergraduate students employed in explaining genetic phenomena and solving problems about them. I characterized two key knowledge types: domain-specific heuristics and domain-specific explanatory schemas that are crucial for understanding the dynamics and entities central to molecular genetics phenomena. I then developed a cognitive model that highlights the role of these powerful conceptual understandings in promoting generative reasoning in genetics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:04Z (GMT).

Nonetheless, learning outcomes often cannot be maintained in the medium term. In order to foster deep and meaningful processing and thereby foster sustainable learning, the single actions of the solution process were segmented into small steps using labels (labeling) to indicate the learning content and/ or an interactive push button (pacing) emphasizing the key feature of each step. 101 university students took part in this study. They examined an unknown computer application with on-screen videos. The results showed a clear advantage of videos with respect to declarative and procedural knowledge in comparison to a standard introduction of the computer application.

Eighty-two (N = 82) college students with little knowledge of the topic were randomly assigned either to the SRL or ERL condition. Learners in the SRL condition regulated their own learning, while learners in the ERL condition had access to a human tutor who facilitated their self- regulated learning. We converged product (pretest to posttest declarative knowledge and qualitative shifts in participants' mental models) with process (think-aloud) data to examine the effectiveness of SRL and ERL on learning about the circulatory system during a 40-minute session. Analysis of the declarative knowledge measures showed that the ERL condition group means were statistically significantly higher than the group means for the SRL condition on the labeling and flow diagram tasks. There were no statistically significant differences between group means on the matching task, but both groups showed statistically significant increases in performance. Further analyses showed no statistically significant differences for the distribution of mental model shift between groups. In terms of self-regulatory processes, participants in the SRL condition engaged in more frequent use of sub-goals, self-questioning, selecting new information sources, re-reading, summarizing, free searching, and enacting control over the context of their learning. In comparison, the ERL participants engaged in more frequent activation of prior knowledge, utilization of feeling of knowing and judgment of learning, monitoring their progress toward goals, drawing, hypothesizing, coordination of information sources, and expressing task difficulty.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:05Z (GMT).

The main topic for investigation is how to predict individual learning outcomes, and in particular the degree to which an individual's prior knowledge and collaborative knowledge construction can influence individual learning outcomes. In this context, the influence of prior knowledge and two measures of instructional support (a content scheme and learners' resource interdependence) were analyzed with respect to collaborative knowledge construction. An empirical study was conducted using 171 university students. Students worked collaboratively in groups of three within a case-based videoconferencing learning environment and were supported by instructional support measures. Results indicate that both an individual's prior knowledge as well as the quality of collaborative knowledge construction strongly impact individual learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:05Z (GMT).

Results support findings from earlier studies about the importance of teachers' perceptions of coherence with their own and their district goals for student learning and the value of active learning strategies. At the same time, our models indicate that the correlates of effective PD vary for different outcomes, and that for program implementation equipment and technical support are critical factors. The results provide guidance for researchers and innovation developers seeking to better understand the conditions which foster implementation, scalability, and sustainability.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:05Z (GMT).

Fieldwork activities were incorporated to further trigger and sustain the online KF discussions in order to facilitate idea improvement and conceptual progress. Toulmin's Argument Pattern (Toulmin, 1958) was used as a tool to analyse the KF discourse pertaining to students' co-construction of arguments. Preliminary findings from this exploratory study indicated that the fifth-grade students could attain a reasonably good level of argumentation. Possible implications to inform the next cycle of the research study as well as for the teaching and learning of argumentation in Science lessons were also discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:06Z (GMT).

We suggest that wiki publishing environments can create learning opportunities that address four dimensions of authenticity: personal, real world, disciplinary, and assessment. We have begun a series of design studies to investigate links between wiki publishing experiences and writing-to-learn. The results of an initial study in an undergraduate government course indicate that perceived audience plays an important role in helping students monitor the quality of writing; however, students' perception of audience on the Internet is not straightforward. This preliminary iteration resulted in several guidelines that are shaping efforts to design and implement new wiki publishing tools and curricula for students and teachers.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:06Z (GMT).

In addition, there have been advancements made in the measurement sciences that allow for sophisticated and complex ways to score and interpret student responses on assessment tasks. However, while many studies have shown the benefits of scientific inquiry in the classroom and others have described new types of psychometric models available for scoring analysis, few have combined the two to develop a better understanding of how students ""know"" science. This paper briefly describes an assessment system used to create items that systematically measure both students' content knowledge as well as two complex inquiry-reasoning skills. Then, using student responses to an assessment made using this system we employ multidimensional psychometric models to allow us to explain the nature of the types of knowledge students draw on when encountering scientific scenarios.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:06Z (GMT).

We examined participants' verbal protocols to determine the relationship between SRL processes and qualitative shifts in students' mental models from pretest to posttest. Results indicated that participants who exhibited a qualitative shift in their mental models, pretest to posttest, displayed differential use of six SRL processes. These SRL processes included metacognitive monitoring activities, learning strategies, and indications of task difficulty. We propose that these SRL processes can account for the participants' shift in mental model.

This study aimed to address this question by examining think-aloud data collected from gifted and grade-level students engaging in a complex learning task while utilizing a hypermedia environment to learn about the circulatory system. We also examined both declarative knowledge and mental model measures of learning to determine whether these groups differed in their actual performance. Our results show that gifted students did outperform grade-level students in all outcome measures. In addition, gifted students more often utilized more sophisticated self-regulatory strategies than grade-level students. Grade-level students were more likely to use less effective strategies that do not promote the encoding of knowledge. Recommendations for future intervention studies are based upon these findings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:07Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Characteristic affordances of concept maps are connection lines representing the relationships between concepts and the labeling of these lines specifying the type of the semantic relationships. To investigate the effects of generat- ing semantic relationships versus labeling existing semantic relationships during prior knowledge activation, 20 psychology students were given two concept-mapping tasks: 1) They had to draw and label the connections between the concepts of a map, and 2) they were given a map of con- cepts with connection lines and had to label the connections. Thinking-aloud protocols indicated more elaboration processes in the labeling-the-lines task than in the finding-and-labeling-the-lines task. On the other hand, the protocols indicated more overview and organization-processes in the finding-and-labeling-the-lines task. Thus, particular concept-mapping tasks elicit qualitative dif- ferences in prior knowledge activation processes, which has important practical implications.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:08Z (GMT).

Next we describe the assessment items completed by teachers participating in the research project, describe the development process of the research team's scoring rubric, and report results from principal component analyses of responses.

A ""worked-out example"" of collaboration realized as an on-screen video was combined with elements of cooperation scripts. In a 2x3 factorial design, the type of support and the type of communication were varied. Audio recordings and performance measures were taken. As first steps of the data analysis, the performance measures of 24 dyads were analyzed and two in -depth case studies were conducted in order to compare the collaboration with and without the support of the developed measures. The collaborators with instructional support made fewer communication errors, managed to better structure the collaborative problem-solving process, and solved the task faster they appear to have learned to collaborate.

This study was undertaken to understand some of the dynamics behind those partnerships. Using activity theory as an analytical lens we found a set of tensions that drove many of the changes that have occurred between the school and its partners. In this paper we document these tensions so others who are working in similar situations will be able to leverage our experience and findings to support urban school change.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:09Z (GMT).

In what follows we look at the design of Byline, an epistemic game engine behind science.net, an epistemic game of science journalism. In particular, we argue that rather than simply recreating the technological conditions of the profession, an epistemic game engine like Byline can encode key elements of a professional practicum and thus help young people learn through participation in simulations of the training practices of socially valued professions such as science journalism.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:09Z (GMT).

Based on a task analysis of the sub-tasks learners must accomplish during mapping, we developed the following support measures: Participants (N = 102) either generated a map (1) from scratch (map-generation), (2) from a list of concepts (concepts-provided), (3) from spatially arranged concepts (concepts-arranged), or, alternatively, they (4) studied a worked-out map (worked-out map). The control-group (5) did not engage in mapping. Presenting a worked-out map enhanced learning most effectively. However, constructing a map from scratch was almost equally helpful. In contrast, students in the half-structured conditions (2 and 3) performed no better than the control condition. We concluded that both studying a worked-out map and generating one's own map allowed learners to devote attention to important parts of the learning contents. Half- structured mapping, in contrast, narrowed attention to specific aspects in a dysfunctional way.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:09Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

As PBS units became more widespread in schools, initial evaluations of their impact focused primarily on documenting important learning outcomes such as performance on unit assessments and standardized exams (Herman, Mackenzie, Sherin, &amp; Reiser, 2002). The motivational impact of PBS units is not so well documented. In particular, little has been done to study motivation across PBS units or across school years. Traditional measures of motivation, first developed primarily by educational and developmental psychologists, were essentially inherited by the learning sciences community and have not been efficient indicators of the impact of curricular innovations on student motivation. We argue for new motivation-related measures that are more closely coupled to the actual experiences of students in projects and report on our initial attempts to develop such measures.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:10Z (GMT).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the design and impact of an innovative learning and performance-support system to facilitate students' development of metacognition and problem solving skills. Detailed descriptions of the theoretical and design frameworks are provided and discussed.

Data come from two second-grade classrooms in which instruction was based on a reform-based curriculum. The study examines the character of the discourse that occurred in these two classrooms. I first identify six distinct discourse structures that were used as building blocks for talking about students' solutions to mathematical problems. I also identify three broad patterns in the ways these structures were used to define interactions in the classrooms. These patterns vary in the level of complexity from getting discourse started to increasingly complex patterns where students were engaging in mathematically complex discussions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:11Z (GMT).

In this paper I examine how comparisons of students' solutions to mathematical tasks were used to foster mathematically significant discourse. Data for this comes from one second- grade classroom in which instruction was based on a reform-based curriculum.

One claim is that this approach can lead to a better understanding of scientific content, where content is understood in its original, narrow sense. As researchers, we would like to know if these claims about student content learning actually hold. Ideally, we would be able to map out students' changing conceptual ecologies. However, such work is theoretically and methodologically difficult. To make this task feasible, we focus on the recurrent functional patterns of knowledge, which we refer to as modes. Using ""mode-sensitive"" clinical interviews with middle school students working with the ""I, Bio"" curriculum, we demonstrate how analysis at the level of modes can capture the landscape of a conceptual ecology, and provide a language for describing the broad sweep of conceptual changes that result from task-structured instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:12Z (GMT).

In two experimental studies, students answered online survey items and were confronted by a frustrating obstacle--an error message pop-up window that blocked them from answering the items. In the first study, ""Survey Sam,"" an animated interface agent was present throughout the survey, and at the end delivered an affective message (apologetic or empathetic) or remained silent. Results revealed that the presence of either message led students to attribute the cause of their frustration to the program instead of to themselves. Further, participants receiving the empathetic message rated Survey Sam as significantly more believable and sincere. The second study investigated the impact of the visual presence of the agent by providing identical messages but with voice only. Results reinforced the value of the agent's visual preference as more effective than voice only, particularly for the empathetic message.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:12Z (GMT).

From a complex systems perspective, convergence in group discussions is an emergent behavior arising from the transactional interactions between group members. Leveraging on the concepts of emergent simplicity and emergent complexity (Bar-Yam, 2003), a set of theoretically-sound yet simple rules was hypothesized: Interactions between group members were conceptualized as goal-seeking adaptations that either help the group move towards or away from its goal, or maintain its status quo. Operationalizing this movement as a Markov walk, we present quantitative and qualitative findings from a study of online problem-solving groups. Findings suggest high (low) quality contributions have a greater positive (negative) impact on convergence when they come earlier in a discussion than later. Significantly, convergence analysis was able to predict a group's performance based on what happened in the first 30-40% of its discussion.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:12Z (GMT).

Compared to scaffolded, well-structured problem-solving groups, un-scaffolded, ill-structured problem-solving groups struggled with defining and solving the problems. Their discussions were chaotic and divergent, resulting in poor group performance. However, despite failing in their problem-solving efforts, these participants outperformed their counterparts in the well-structured condition on transfer measures, suggesting a latent productivity in the failure. The study's contrasting-case design provided participants in the un-scaffolded condition with an opportunity to contrast the ill-structured problems that they had solved in groups with the well-structured problems they solved individually afterwards. This contrast facilitated a spontaneous transfer, helping them perform significantly better on the individual ill-structured problem-solving tasks subsequently. Implications of productive failure for the development of adaptive expertise are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:12Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A state-standards-based math exam and an inventory on attitudes toward mathematics were used in pretest and posttest. Students' gender, socio economic status, and prior math ability were examined as the moderating variables. Results indicated that gaming in cooperative goal structure was most effective in promoting positive math attitudes while classroom goal structure for gaming had no significant impact on students' math test performance. It was also found that students of different socio-economic statuses were influenced differently by the gaming conditions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:13Z (GMT).

We want students to be able to reason about evidence and evaluate knowledge claims. This requires an understanding about the epistemology of science and inquiry practices. In this paper, we propose a functional approach for using students' epistemologies to guide inquiry practices. In our design, students use a set of criteria that reflects epistemologies of science and guides construction and evaluation of explanations in their scientific investigations. We use argumentation to create a need for students to use these criteria to compare and evaluate one another's explanations. This study takes place in a 7th grade project-based ecology unit. Our analysis shows that these criteria guide students as they construct and evaluate explanations. During this process, students enhance their epistemologies of science and the quality of their scientific work products.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:13Z (GMT).

Programs find it hard to properly train preservice teachers for a variety of reasons, both structural and pedagogical. One reason is that students bring their prior beliefs about teaching with them into their preservice programs. In the past we lacked sufficient tools to uncover these entering beliefs. This study employs drawings and interviews to uncover preservice secondary teachers' prior beliefs and knowledge about the use of technology in teaching. These methods offer a counterpoint to quantitative approaches often used to study preservice teacher beliefs regarding technology. Our analysis of the data from preservice teacher interviews resulted in a diagram that illuminates incoming teachers' orientation toward their future technology-infused teaching. This study provides methodological guidance for examining and improving teachers' learning about technology integration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:13Z (GMT).

This paper describes three exploratory studies that investigated the potential of virtual peers (VP, animated digital characters designed as peer-like) to scaffold college students' motivation towards lesson-planning tasks. The studies examined how differing characteristics of the VPs motivated learners, as measured by learners' task-related self-efficacy beliefs and learner interest in the task and in working with the VPs. Study 1 examined the competency and interaction type of a VP; Study 2 examined the gender and emotional expression of VPs; and Study 3 examined the gender and emotional response of VPs. Results indicated the close relationships between learner motivation and VP characteristics. These findings support for the instructional utility of the virtual peers as motivational scaffolds.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:13Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This, in turn, is expected to allow for rich problem analyses and solutions. On the other hand, these same differences can cause discussions in multidisciplinary teams to become veritable towers of Babel. This is because team members assume that what they say is properly understood (actually interpreted) by other team members and vice versa. Unfortunately, these differences in domain specific knowledge, background, opinions, et cetera stand in the way of this mutual understanding. Both meaning and position need to be understood and accepted before team members achieve the common ground necessary. The research reported on here shows how a negotiation formalism that was implemented in and ICT-tool coerced team members to negotiate both the meaning of each others contributions to the solution of a complex problem and their positions with respect to each others contributions so as to achieve more common ground. The results show that this coercion had positive effects on common ground without negatively affecting interaction within the teams.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:14Z (GMT).

Few studies, however, have examined adult assistance strategies that enable youth to assume responsibility for complex campaigns or formulate policy proposals. Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork in an urban after- school leadership group, this article examines how adults and youth jointly created a ""youth-led"" environment, in which youth took responsibility for making decisions and monitoring their work. Data analysis focuses on the cultural tools that youth appropriated in order to assume leadership of the project, including group agreements, group organizing routines, and a youth empowerment ideology. The paper concludes that to support youth voice adults must do more than just fade into the background, but must also seed the learning community with tools. Implications address how adults can help young people lead efforts to improve their schools and neighborhoods.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:14Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

But what becomes of the materials developed after the research is completed? A key challenge for the Learning Sciences is to address the issue of sustainability for the materials we develop. Professional development (PD) can help teachers make adaptations to the written curriculum while maintaining its integrity. We examine empirical data from a study of PD in the context of inquiry- oriented curricular reform to show how PD aligned with written curriculum and informed by enacted curriculum can influence teachers' practice in ways that are consistent with the goals of the curriculum designers. We conclude with a model for PD design informed both by the written and enacted curriculum to facilitate teacher planning that allows for adaptations that maintain fidelity to the curriculum design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:15Z (GMT).

The research focused on the role of text genre (narrative and expository text), text cohesion (high or low) and the readers' level of prior world knowledge (assessed using the WoodcockJohnson III Academic Knowledge test). Sixty-four students in the fourth grade read four texts, including one high-cohesion and one low-cohesion text from each genre. Comprehension of each text was assessed with 12 multiple-choice questions, including both local questions (focusing on specific information contained in one or two sentences) and global questions (focusing on general themes). Children showed better comprehension of the narrative than expository texts, but this advantage appeared only on global questions. There was a benefit of higher knowledge, but only for the expository texts. The benefits of cohesion were greatest for narrative text comprehension and on global questions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We posit that fostering the practice of argumentation requires transforming classroom interactions in order to create a need for students to attend to each other's claims and evidence. This paper examines the enactment of a 7th grade ecology unit created to generate this need and support these discussions. Our analyses of the student discussions show students moving beyond typical classroom interactions in order to understand the ways in which their claims differ and to evaluate one another's claims, in light of the evidence. Thus, we conclude that this approach of creating a need and supporting students as they attend to and critically evaluate one another's claims and evidence appears to be a promising strategy for fostering scientific argumentation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:15Z (GMT).

Student attitudes towards diversity and towards the technology used in the course are discussed. The students reported using the tool to explore and to equalize cultural and demographic differences. They showed significant improvement on a measure of sensitivity towards an understanding of diversity, and evidence suggests they were able to develop a more sophisticated, less essentialist model of diversity.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:16Z (GMT).

However, few qualitative studies described the essential aspects of the PBL learning processes, such as self-directed learning, and its impact on the building of professional knowledge. Therefore, this study illuminates students' ability to select, evaluate and make use of learning resources, a form of self-directed learning, embedded in a social context. This study aimed to 1) reveal different kinds of resources acquired and presented by students during discussions and to 2) describe patterns of knowledge building that emerged from integration of the above learning resources and consequently led to professional knowledge building. Using qualitative research methods, I analyzed 751 text messages from a distance learning class. The results revealed seven kinds of commonly used resources in the discussion. Results also show knowledge building occurred through the process of 1) enriching conceptual understanding, 2) connecting textbook information and personal experiences, and 3) comparing theories and practical approaches.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:16Z (GMT).

One is whether or not the representation maintains a high level of epistemic fidelity. The other is whether or not the representation is transparent relative to the content it is supposed to represent. We believe that these criteria are too limited in scope and have been considered acceptable in part because we have a very limited understanding of how students construct meaningful interpretations of unfamiliar representations. To remedy that, we propose a new framework for understanding acts of interpretation that focuses on four major constructs: registrations, symbolic forms, interpretive genres, and interpretive maxims. We demonstrate this framework's utility by applying it to excerpts of middle school students interpreting unfamiliar representations of light reflection.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:16Z (GMT).

This paper represents part of a larger study that examines and describes tensions and tradeoffs in a ""design for science"" classroom, Learning by DesignTM. We examine tensions in a lecture on forces in which the teacher finds herself challenged to build representational bridges between students' designed artifacts and abstract science concepts. Constrained by time and difficulty of the concepts, the teacher chooses a tradeoff that uses a lecture to provide students a model for the science underlying their designs. Our examination reveals the teacher's struggle with representation, the requirement that she engage in modeling, and the importance of in-depth pedagogical content knowledge to successful design-based science instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:17Z (GMT).

The training group's performance was assessed by standardized test items and compared with that of a high-SES no training comparison group. The results demonstrate that instructional methods based on experimental psychological research have great potential for addressing the achievement gap problem. However, the analyses also reveal a significant discrepancy between low-SES students' performance on standardized test items and on alternative assessments with lower reading and writing demands. We discuss our methodological choices in making basic research more relevant to real world issues. We highlight the critical challenges of test validity, research relevancy, and reform feasibility for researchers and policymakers. Introduction Current federal legislation on education (No Child Left Behind Act, 2002) listed the following as necessary conditions for closing the achievement gap: 1) adopting research-based teaching practices, 2) having high quality teachers, and 3) using standardized tests as accountability measures. We tested this legislative assumption by putting instructional resources presumably meeting these three conditions into low-SES urban school science classrooms. Specifically, we adapted for classroom use instruction and materials previously tested in random- assignment experimental studies. We ensured teacher quality and implementation fidelity by having a researcher- teacher conduct the classroom instruction under the supervision of an experienced classroom teacher. We held ourselves accountable by measures consisting of both researcher-designed assessment instruments and original standardized test items selected from publicly or commercially available standardized tests, such as the Third International Mathematics and Science Study [TIMSS], the National Assessment for Educational Progress [NAEP], and the Terra Nova Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills [CTBS]. We tested whether this instructional scenario, designed specifically to meet the above NCLB criteria, would close the achievement gap in one single topic area in our local setting. Through this evaluation, we assessed the potential for basic psychological research to inform practice, explored the adaptations researchers need to make in transferring research-based instruction to classroom settings, and encountered new challenges for basic experimental studies to become practical and relevant for real- world classrooms. We set as our instructional goal the mastery of an important component skill of scientific inquiry how to design unconfounded scientific experiments. It is a skill explicitly included in nearly all national and state science inquiry standards (e.g., American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1993; National Research Council [NRC], 1996). Standardized science tests at international, national, and state levels have consistently assessed this particular inquiry component (e.g., International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement TIMSS 1995 released items; National Center for Education Statistics NAEP 1996 released items). In addition to its prominence in K-12 science education, experimental design skill has also been well studied in cognitive and psychological research in terms of its acquisition (with or without training), development, and transfer (e.g., Ross, 1988; Chen &amp; Klahr, 1999; Klahr &amp; Nigam, 2004; Klahr &amp; Li, 2005; Kuhn, Amsel, &amp; O'Loughlin, 1988). Like only a few handful domains in science (e.g., forces and motions in physics), designing experiments is at a point of convergence among science standards, standardized assessments, and basic research. Such convergence makes the mastery of this skill an ideal instructional goal under which to explore issues of research, practice, and assessment. Background Children up to late elementary school age have only a partial grasp of the logic and procedure of experimental design (Kuhn, Garcia-Mila, Zohar, &amp; Anderson, 1995; Schauble, 1996). However, these deficiencies do not imply a lack of developmental readiness to learn. Training studies have shown that various methods, ranging from mere exposure to experimental tasks to explicit instruction, can improve children's understanding and use of variable control (Case, 1974; Kuhn &amp; Angelev, 1976; Ross, 1988; Schauble, 1996; Chen &amp; Klahr, 1999).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:17Z (GMT).

The study investigated the effects of two instructional approaches (whole-task vs. part- task) and levels of learner expertise (novice vs. advanced) on learner acquisition and transfer of a complex cognitive skill (e.g., preparing a grade book in excel) in an introductory educational technology course. The study also examined the effects of these variables on learners' cognitive load, instructional efficiency, time on task and their attitudes towards the instruction. The results indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups (whole-task &gt; part-task) on (a) whole-task performance, (b) far-transfer performance, (c) instructional efficiency on the whole-task performance, and d) instructional efficiency on the far-transfer performance. However, no significant differences were found for (a) cognitive load, (b) time spent on the whole-task test, (c) time spent on the far-transfer test, and (d) attitudes toward instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:18Z (GMT).

However, little is known about the kinds of observations and explanations early elementary school students can make and the ways educative curriculum materials can support students' and teachers' learning about these inquiry practices. In this study, we describe the quality of second graders' drawings and descriptions of their observations and the explanations they construct from their observations during an inquiry-based unit. Our results show that despite some success in making drawings, descriptions, and explanations, children still face many difficulties when engaged in these inquiry tasks. These findings suggest specific areas in which scaffolding for students may be warranted. The findings also point to areas where it may be important to provide additional guidance for teachers. We make recommendations for these student and teacher supports.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:18Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We investigated: (1) teachers' understanding of curriculum design principles; and (2) the role of teachers' experiences with curriculum units in their understanding of underlying unit structures. Using clinical interviews, we identified patterns in teachers' understanding. We found that teachers do not understand design principles and the relationships between these principles and lessons well, although more experienced teachers seem to know more than less experienced peers. Teachers also have difficulty identifying connections among lessons and therefore the overall unit structures. Both of these findings are problematic for curriculum developers seeking implementation that is ""true"" to the intentions of the materials. This study helps to inform future design of curriculum units, professional development, and tools that help teachers understand unit structures.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:18Z (GMT).

Several features shared by complex systems hinder deep understanding. For example, understanding complex systems involves thinking about multiple interdependent levels, non-linear causality and/or emergence. Conceptual representations offer opportunities to become integrating frameworks across different domains. This study investigates how alternative conceptual representations embodied in hypermedia can help middle school students better understand a complex system, the human respiratory system. We designed two versions of instructional hypermedia based on structure-behavior-function theory. SBF is a conceptual representation that is part of the disciplinary toolbox of biologists and thus is an appropriate representation for learning in this domain. One hypermedia was function-centered while the other was structure-centered. We contrasted the instructional effects of these two alternative conceptual representations. Students using the function-centered hypermedia developed deeper understanding than those using the structure-centered version on one of the two measures. Implications and limitations are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:19Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Design of research projects can take an expansive approach, considering outcomes from both the learning and the sustainability and scalability perspectives. In the deployment of the research projects, an effective professional development model is needed so that learning science researchers and practitioners can deepen their understanding of each other's context and perspectives.

This is a novel use of technology, so we first had to ensure that this new multi-device paradigm would not, via extraneous cognitive load, interfere with inquiry learning tasks. In this pilot study, we confirmed that the multi-device interface can be used by the lower age range of our target demographic, and that its use does not impair the execution of inquiry learning tasks of the sort we have designed for the learning environment.

However, they have rarely been applied to education. Most empirical studies of implicit learning and knowledge have used experimental paradigms. We argue that in order for these notions to be investigated in real-world educational situations, other research methods are necessary. In light of this, we report the results of an interview study of implicit knowledge in computer programming education. Several cues that helped us to determine that knowledge was implicit are explained and illustrated with examples. We conclude the interviews can be useful in investigating nonconscious knowledge and offer some observations concerning implicit knowledge about programming that became apparent from this study.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:20Z (GMT).

Using an action- research model, we have designed and studied this course. In this paper we report on our study of the students' collaborations. We have found that, although students come to the class believing that they know how to collaborate, there is great variation in their collaborative experiences and outcomes. We outline four dimensions of collaboration that differentiate high and low performing groups, where performances is determined by project quality and student learning. These dimensions, `teamness', communication, creation of a joint problem space and commitment to learning, have been defined through analysis of the ten groups of students who have taken this course. In this paper we use case studies to illustrate how these dimensions have differentially affected two groups who took the course. Finally, we describe our interventions and the parallels between this study and other research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:20Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The learning strategy is based on student investigations of real phenomena using sensors and of virtual environments based on computer models. The new materials take advantage of computers, sensors, handhelds, and electronic networking to more effectively teach students and give them deeper insights into the process of science inquiry.

Results suggest that students in both conditions used some strategies inconsistently during learning. Specifically, the frequency with which students took notes, re-read, and selected new informational sources significantly fluctuated throughout the 30 minute learning task. Results also indicate that students in the conceptual scaffolding condition summarized significantly more during the 30-minute learning task.

It also investigated the impact of laptop integration on students' attitudes and perceptions of the classroom environment compared to control classrooms. Issues under student perceptions included: a) perceived importance of technology; b) computer enjoyment; c) student-teacher and student-student interactions; and d) motivation toward school and learning. The study used both quantitative and qualitative data. Although some evidence indicated that fourth grade laptop students had more positive attitudes toward school than fourth grade non-laptop students, quantitative data did not reveal significant differences among laptop and control students. Qualitative data, however, painted a positive picture of experiences in laptop classrooms. Laptop students perceived computers as important learning tools and consistently used educational applications to perform academic activities. Such activities influenced classroom interactions and created a sense of pride and empowerment among laptop students. These behaviors were not evident among control students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:21Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, merely seeing video-cases without in-depth, interpretive analysis may not ensure learning. This study examined the effects of cognitive, metacognitive, combination, and affective questions, on preservice teachers' declarative knowledge of formative assessment, case- interpretation skills and ability to redesign formative assessments in similar and novel classroom contexts. All participants showed significant improvements from pretest to posttest on declarative knowledge and case-interpretation skills. A-priori planned contrasts revealed that the cognitive- questions group outperformed the metacognitive group on declarative knowledge whereas the metacognitive-questions group outperformed the cognitive group on video case-interpretation at posttest and transfer tasks. The results suggest practical implications for using specific scaffolding questions that are effective in improving conceptual knowledge and applied case-interpretation skills during contrasting video case analysis activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:21Z (GMT).

This paper examines a group of students and teachers who implemented the Knowledge Forum model (Scardamalia, 2004) over the course of two years. Interviews with the students are used to assess three epistemological changes identified as critical in the Knowledge Forum model: a shift from teacher-directed activities to student epistemic agency, a shift from right and wrong answers to the notion of improvable ideas, and a shift from individual to community knowledge and collective responsibility. There are indications that shifts are indeed taking place in students' views toward their own agency in the learning process, the dynamic nature of knowledge, and the importance of community. The work also identifies challenges faced by teachers in implementing new models of learning that can inform teacher pedagogy.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:22Z (GMT).

Rather than expressing some transcendent notion of a universal logic of formal entities (e.g., sets) that supercedes our knowable experience, we articulate an embodiment perspective, whereby Boolean classes are conceptual metaphors for apprehending and manipulating data, concepts and categories the same way we perceive and manipulate worldly objects and containers. Drawing on examples from seminal approaches to qualitative methods, we demonstrate how one central aspect of qualitative research practices--the process of coding data--can productively be viewed in terms of collecting and containing concepts and categories in this embodied sense. We discuss the implications of this for coding and for bridging qualitative and quantitative methods of inquiry.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

DIVER establishes a unique video platform for users to control a ""virtual camera window"" on a computer for guiding noticing to parts of a video of interest as the video is playing--then to text annotate these moments, and publish them on the web for further collaborative analysis. Every DIVER user--researcher, teacher, or learner--can thus express their visual and interpretive point of view on a video, providing an important and accessible tool for making a difference in our research and education.

We relied on longitudinal data obtained from two surveys of teachers' social networks and self-reported effects of their school's initiative on their practice. Among resources analyzed, we found that access to materials and time for collaboration per se were not predictive of teacher change, but reported access to mentors and coaches was. We also found that when teachers received help from colleagues who had already been implementing their school's initiative, they were significantly more likely to change their practice. Taken together, these two findings suggest that interactions with colleagues function as continually changing resources that help individuals interpret and apply the demands of initiatives for their own practice, helping reduce variability in reform implementation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:23Z (GMT).

More specifically, this pilot study investigates (1) if learners differentiate between tasks of different complexity, set goals and plan accordingly and (2) whether such adaptive learning behavior is influenced by their epistemological beliefs. Students (n = 72) inspected a set of six learning tasks and answered multiple questions derived from the COPES-model of self-regulated learning (Winne &amp; Hadwin, 1998), e.g. they judged the importance of specific learning strategies for a particular learning task. Furthermore, they filled in inventories measuring their epistemological beliefs. Results confirmed significant influences of task complexity and epistemological beliefs on students' judgments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:23Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These same technologies also support new ways of capturing and analyzing information on student thinking. This paper reports on research that used a digital learning environment (complete with prose, graphics, animations, and agents) to provide elementary school readers a scientific text containing embedded free-response assessment items to capture information on their thought processes. This paper explores methodological issues associated with coding and analyzing constructed response items of this type. Drawing on established approaches to propositional analysis with extensions to reflect the multimodal nature of the text and the task, we present a methodological approach developed to balance detail and nuance in students' use of language with a systematized approach to analyzing those data. This discussion is presented for both its value to the learning sciences and as a contribution to critical discussions about assessing student learning in complex learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:24Z (GMT).

In this paper, we present the findings of a mixed-methods study we designed, based upon this framework, to examine student role- and goal- adoption in two seventh-grade science classrooms where students participated in the ""What Will Survive"" life sciences curriculum, and discuss ways in which we plan to revise our framework based on the study results.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:24Z (GMT).

These representations were designed to help students in mentally bridging the gap between motion phenomena and abstract line graphs. In the first study, contrary to our expectations, the employed representations did not only not improve learning - but even impeded it. This finding was underpinned by the second study, in which almost no sign was found of students having internalized the relevant aspects of the dynamic representations. Because similar results have recently been found in other studies, we propose that research on learning with dynamic representations should not only focus on developing guidelines for the external design of representations but also on conceptualising learning strategies which can be taught to students and which help them to successfully process the information presented in the external representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:24Z (GMT).

Further, the goal of my research has not only been to understand how students learn from hypertext but also to identify how students use hypertext in the context of inquiry-based science classes. In my research program, I conducted a series a studies to explore these two issues in parallel. My studies have helped identify factors that affect student learning from digital text, moving toward a conceptual model of learning from multiple linked texts. In addition, they have also helped identify successful teacher strategies used to help students learn from hands-on investigations and digital resources.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:25Z (GMT).

Accordingly, we seek to develop decision-making scaffolds that increase the incorporation of numerical information into preferences. Two experiments contrast five techniques for presenting students with numerical information and prompting them to make decisions related to that information. The techniques are based on a method called EPIC (Estimate, Prefer, Incorporate feedback, and Change preference) from the Numerically-Driven Inferencing (NDI) paradigm. Results regarding post-feedback preferences indicate that having students estimate a quantity's value beforehand increases the impact on preferences when the quantity's true value is presented. However, having students state initial preferences does not yield an analogous effect. An attractive explanation for the estimation effect is that estimating diminishes hindsight bias, making information that diverges from expectations more surprising. Variants of the EPIC method may serve as ""micro-interventions"" that increase the impact of numerical data on preferences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:26Z (GMT).

To explore these congruencies we use the framework of transformative research, which is research that while focused on generating new ideas also works to ""transform"" or improve the teaching and learning of science. This paper describes our collaboration with one public middle school in New York City, using the concepts of congruencies to frame our efforts with the school as we collaboratively developed a project- based school-wide science curriculum plan. Through this process we learned both about ways to consider innovative reforms in relation to this school setting, and more general characteristics of conducting transformative research with urban schools.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:26Z (GMT).

As predicted, there were no improvements in students' historical understanding in the DGT or presentation format conditions. However, there were main effects for DGT and presentation format on students' depth of processing as measured by the number of added, borrowed and transformed sentences in an argument writing task. There was also a main effect for DGT on students' recall of document source information, an indication of the use of a sourcing heuristic and component of expert historical thinking. Results provide cautionary evidence for educational policy and classroom practice about document-based assessment practices, and the continued advocacy of multiple primary source document use.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:27Z (GMT).

Results indicate selected websites housed a large amount of redundant non-diverse information. Website content was available in local media resources, consisted of textbook accounts, and focused on traditional historical topics; only one of ten websites was diverse. A four-cluster model provides further support for a discussion about the Internet, as currently used and framed, leading to less diversity of ideas and voices within the classroom, anathema to the stated democratic purposes of the social studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:27Z (GMT).

The unique feature in CeLS's design is its ability to use learners' products from previous stages and to conduct complex, multi-stage, structured activities. CeLS provides a sample of content-free Activity Structures and a searchable domain of all the activities that were implemented with students. Teachers can explore these examples, adopt them for personal use and adapt their structure and content to suit their specific needs. If none of the existing pre-designed resources seems to suit the needs, they can create new structures using basic building blocks.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:27Z (GMT).

The details shared here come mainly from a comparative analysis of our last two assessment design cycles, highlighting differences between two common activity structures: a culminating student presentation and a global summit debate. We found that reframing the task and attending to a few specific elements of the teachers' and students' roles both before and during the activity resulted in two significant impacts. First, the debate activity transformed the student learning that took place in terms of its rigor and relevance, making it more characteristic of what we describe as ""Quadrant D learning."" Second, the debate greatly increased our teachers' ability to assess their students' learning of desired content and skills, making it an even more effective embedded assessment activity than the final presentation alone.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:28Z (GMT).

These critiques represent an oversimplification of Erikson's theory and overlook the centrality of the co-development of the individual and society within his theory of identity development. To justify this claim, we examine Erikson's concepts of ego identity (1959, 1968), and demonstrate overlap with Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, and Cain's `figured worlds' framework (1998). The purpose of these comparisons is to problematize essentialist critiques of Erikson and create a dialogic space for socio-cultural researchers to consider Erikson's psychosocial theory of identity formation when exploring relationships between identity, agency, power and cultural worlds of practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:29Z (GMT).

Ninety-six questions from the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test for 7/9th graders were analyzed in terms of individual item characteristics and passage features that were considered to affect the item's difficulty. Whereas two passage features, word frequency and sentence length, influenced the item difficulty, none of the individual question characteristics were found to affect the item difficulty. Thus, the GMRT may be assessing how difficult a passage readers can comprehend, not how difficult a question readers can answer about a passage. These findings imply that the GMRT may function well when identifying basic reading comprehension skill differences, but not higher level reading skill differences. However, these findings may be the result of the passages in the GMRT having an atypical construction. Specifically, shorter passages tended to be composed of longer sentences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:29Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Both model and script showed positive effects. The current study was designed to further probe the effects of model and script by comparing them to conditions (model-plus, script-plus) in which the learning was further supported by providing elaboration support (instructional prompts and guided self- explanation). 40 dyads were tested, 8 in each of the following conditions: model plus elaboration, model, script plus elaboration, script, control. Observing a model collaboration with elaboration support yielded the best results over all other conditions on several measures of the quality of collaborative process and on outcome variables. Model without elaboration was second best. The results for the script conditions were mixed; on some variables even below those of the control condition.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:29Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In their attempt to assess this goal, many educators and researchers evaluate student inquiry based on how well their conceptual understanding aligns with canonical knowledge. Such assessments fail to recognize other more valuable aspects of inquiry. We assert that mechanistic reasoning, shown by the history and philosophy of science literatures to be vital in the construction of scientific knowledge, is a more appropriate dimension along which to measure the quality of inquiry. We present a coding scheme designed to identify this reasoning and use it to analyze a discussion among second grade students about why juice boxes collapse when you suck on their straws. Assessing their mechanistic reasoning in this way reveals a value and sophistication that is obscured by current measures of conceptual correctness.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:30Z (GMT).

Using Activity Theory for apriori structuring of the data set and these three progressive issues for invivo analysis, the researcher found that the teachers implemented the innovation cluster in relation to their ability to identify and overcome contradictions in their work activity.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:30Z (GMT).

This study seeks to address this issue through the SEEK training program, which encourages learners to evaluate the source and quality of the information, and also how well it resonates with their existing prior knowledge. Learners were either trained or not trained using the SEEK program when they completed an initial Internet research task. Learners were then asked to complete a second Internet research task in another domain without any additional guidance several days later. Results indicate that learners who had received the SEEK training not only were better able to identify relevant from irrelevant sources, but also showed both higher overall levels of learning, and also greater learning gains.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:31Z (GMT).

Such teacher educative materials would be designed to explicitly enhance teacher thinking in relationship to students and science in classroom contexts. Designing materials specifically for teacher learning, however, is an intriguing yet largely untested idea. In this study, one 7th grade teacher used five inquiry science units with varying amounts and types of educative features over a two year period. Written pre and post lesson teacher reflections, informal interviews, and daily classroom videotape were collected. Analysis focused on aspects of inquiry teaching that are challenging for teachers to learn and illustrate pedagogical content knowledge. Comparisons overtime and between lessons with different types and amounts of educative support in the materials were made. Analysis identified characteristics of materials that guide teacher thinking and support inquiry science teaching.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The framework uses the dimensions of innovation and efficiency to characterize learning tasks according to the types of knowledge they should promote. Innovation tasks involve the construction of novel solutions to unfamiliar problems while efficiency tasks feature repeated application of optimal solutions. The former are intended to help students appreciate key features of an expert solution while the latter aim to increase speed and accuracy. The overarching hypothesis was that having an opportunity to innovate would promote productive collaboration and learning more than efficiently copying and studying correct answers. The first experiment, involving third graders, found benefits of innovation for individual learning. The second, with university students working collaboratively, found effects of innovation on interaction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

With this move has come a focus on projects with the potential to create systemic change rather than naturalistic studies of learning in context and design research to develop innovative interventions. We argue that this is based on a misreading history, and is counter-productive for learning science research. To make this case, we use Latour's (1983) study of Pasteur to suggest an alternative model for research-based transformation of education. By way of illustration, we use a brief example of a research project to ground a discussion of the broader implications of this alternative conceptualization of the process of learning sciences research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:33Z (GMT).

The findings show that the teachers tended to generate an additive rule, which is limited and contextualized, of balance condition, and failed to incorporate the more general multiplicative rule when thinking about balance. The study also shows that the teachers had difficulty in grasping a mathematical formula of balance condition. The learning outcome was partly a natural result of the materials the teachers used and the tasks they carried out.

Achievements were indicated by final grades in two successive school years, whereas self-perceptions, interest and goal orientation were measured at the beginning of the second school year. Data were analyzed by means of structural equation modelling. The analyses showed that students' self-perceptions strongly predicted subsequent achievement over and above the prediction that could be made from prior achievement.

We discuss two roles of animations: a constructivist tool to support visualization and interpretation of chemical processes, and a problem-solving tool to support reasoning about chemical phenomena. We developed Chemation, a handheld-based chemistry animation tool, to address the roles. We conducted an initial evaluation study to assess the impact of Chemation for supporting students' visualization, interpretation, and reasoning of chemical phenomena. Two teachers and 73 seventh grade students participated in the study. The results of pre- and posttests indicated a positive gross effect of the learning environment including all aspects such as teacher and tool supports. Close examination through classroom observations, student interviews, and student artifacts revealed the relationships between student learning and tool supports. The results inform the design of interactive learning environments that incorporate animation as a learning support.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:34Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

What we call group cognition is a discourse-centered analysis of the interactional basis of collaborative knowledge building, establishing common ground and co-constructing shared meaning. This epistemological perspective has methodological, technological and pedagogical implications. It directs empirical analysis toward the manifold forms of referencing that constitute small-group communication. Studies of how students actually make sense of, adapt and adopt referential affordances in computational media are used to inform the design of educational software environments. In particular, we are developing an online service for groups of people to discuss mathematical themes. This paper looks at how a group of students used methods of referencing to co-construct geometric objects in a chat room with graphical referencing tools.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:35Z (GMT).

In this paper, we provide empirical evidence substantiating previous claims about the potential of games for learning and offer specific design heuristics that might inform their future production and use. Using codes based on AAAS benchmarks and Chinn and Malhotra's (2002) framework for evaluating inquiry tasks, we examine the scientific habits of mind that characterize online discussion forums of the MMOG World of Warcraft and the features of the game both as designed object and emergent culture that appear to foster them.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:35Z (GMT).

While models do not appear to vary with ethnicity, a significant association was found between model group and strategy usage (p = .032). In addition, the robust group achieved higher scores on their final solution than the traits-based group (p = .03). The robust group made excellent use of the tools in the environment to solve the problem. The traits-based group did not. The robust group evidenced an environmental view of learning. The traits-based group displayed a mental representations view of learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:36Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We focus on the design-build-test cycle used by professional engineers in simulation- based rapid modeling. In this experiment, middle school students worked for 10 hours to solve engineering design challenges using SodaConstructor--a Java-based microworld--as a simulation environment. As a result of the experiment, students learned about center of mass. Our data further suggest that in the process of simulation-based modeling, rapid iterations of the design- build-test cycle progressively linked students' interest in the design activities and understanding of the concept of center of mass. We suggest that these rapid iterations of the design-build-test cycle functioned as exploratoids: short fragments of exploratory action in a microworld that cumulatively develop interest in and understanding of important scientific concepts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:36Z (GMT).

There were no significant pretest-posttest differences between the groups on comprehension questions that could be answered from a single sentence within a passage.

How do ""experts"" become ""novices"" and move in directions that require them to put aside their theories of action? How does a group of experts collectively accomplish that? From our experiences as members of the ACE teacher educator team, and the research we have done on the team over the past three years, we propose that not only is the novice state of mind essential for professional development, change, and creativity, it also enables the teacher educator to empathize with students' experiences of being novices. We propose a new way of looking at the term ""professional development"" which suggests that ""novice"" is not the opposite of ""expert"". These two states are not different sides of the same continuum - they can exist simultaneously.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:38Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Both were taught by the same teacher, used the same curriculum materials, engaged in the same learning activities, and were comprised of equally engaged and high achieving honors students. Yet over a 20-week period, the question-asking and answering practices of students in the two classes diverged considerably. While students in Class A were still struggling to adopt the practices modeled by the teacher, students in Class B were taking the initiative to ask each other to explain trends identified in investigations and working out explanations together. Investigating differences between these two near-identical enactments has allowed us to identify changes in question-asking practices that lead to productive interpretations and science discourse. We offer explanations for the differences between the classes and for the changes observed over time.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:38Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It is often assumed that performance improves when information is externalized onto the interface. Although relieving working memory this may discourage planning, understanding and knowledge acquisition. When information is not externalized, it must be internalized, stored in the user's memory, requiring more planning and thinking, perhaps leading to better performance and knowledge. Another variable influencing behavior is the cognitive style of users. We included ""Need for Cognition"" (NFC), the tendency to engage in cognitive tasks. We investigated the effects of interface style and NFC using planning tasks. The internalization interface led to more planful behavior and smarter solutions, but NFC had no effect. Understanding reactions to interface information is crucial in designing software aimed at education and learning. To facilitate active learning and provoke better performance, designers should take care in giving users (too) much assistance.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:39Z (GMT).

At the beginning of the yearlong course, only 76% of students correctly identified the better project. Toward the end of the course, the majority of students correctly identified the superior example; however, many failed to note serious flaws in the poor example. Analyses of student justifications showed that most students used superficial reasons (e.g., readability) initially and deeper structural reasons (e.g., process) on the post-test.

The reasons why people seek other perspectives were also investigated. The results showed that the number of perspectives used in defining problems was significantly correlated with the number of solutions generated later. Subjects with higher MP thinking scores were able to define problems from more perspectives and generate more solutions. Native English speakers wanted to hear other perspectives more because they wanted to confirm their thinking, while non-native English speakers wanted other perspectives more because they wanted to understand the scenarios better. The main implication is that there may be a culture difference in people's MP thinking ability and perception of multiple perspectives, and it might be possible to train people on their MP thinking to improve their problem solving performance.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:40Z (GMT).

We sketch the transition from early experiments with commercially available tools to a series of studies conducted with a research tool finally to the design of a platform which provides the technical basis to a scalable public service. For this design we had to take into account requirements from students, tutors, the service provider as well as researchers from various disciplines. We discuss some design decisions which lead to a platform which addresses the diverse requirements of the various stakeholders. The paper underscores the value of a design-based research process and a self- reflexive process as we develop insights about online math problem solving.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:41Z (GMT).

Cool Modes provides different modelling environments allowing learners to co-construct representations of domain-specific models. These systems range from curriculum topics such as stochastic to subjects with a non-standard character such as astronomy. In the current study we focus upon the Stochastic palette and the Moon palette, which both provide visual languages to support modelling activities specifically in the subject matter area of mathematics. These visual languages are embedded in the Cool Modes Framework providing tools for annotating and enriching the co-constructive modelling process. Both palettes have been tested and adapted for learning scenarios taking place in formal and informal learning environments. In this paper we report the findings from observational material collected from 3 classes in Germany using Cool Modes. The observation concentrates upon assessing the effectiveness of supporting co- constructive modelling activities in a synchronous learning setting.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:41Z (GMT).

Individual group members benefit because the connections between their analyses and data can be effectively warranted; the larger group benefits because the location of interpretive differences is more precisely exposed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:43Z (GMT).

Twenty-one k/1st students created photo journals using a digital camera and iPhoto software. When children talked about their pictures and created captions for their journals, they demonstrated different kinds of autobiographical memory, as well as revealing gender-specific social views. First-graders showed greater awareness of their own memory capability (metamemory) in talking about their pictures than kindergarteners. Digital images seemed to present a relatively immediate yet imperfect or incomplete reminder that encouraged children's elaboration. Besides the process of journal construction, the contents of children's journals also reveal aspects of memory and social cognition that expand our existing knowledge in these areas.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:43Z (GMT).

The framework is applied to the design and delivery of the first two years of a three- year study aimed at improving teacher and student understanding of computational modeling tools. We demonstrate that structuring a professional development program around these principles facilitates the development of important strategies such as the identification of salient system variables, effectively distributing expertise, and constructing curricular adaptations. We discuss two meta-level themes that may account for the success of the principles: attending to structure vs. agency and setting short-term vs. long-term goals. Each illustrates the tension existing between competing variables that need to be considered to effectively program for professional development around educational technology with the goal of sustaining and scaling innovations in real world complex educational systems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:44Z (GMT).

Analysis using Logistic Regression identified a model that differentiated the PBLC and DI approaches in areas of preservice teachers' perceived knowledge of technology integration and technology competencies, and revealed that preservice teachers who reported more favorable computer use and more knowledge of e-portfolio development were more likely to be in the PBLC approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:45Z (GMT).

This framework has been extended by educational researchers to understand student activity in science classrooms (Tuminaro and Redish, 2005), in computer games (Shaffer, 2005) and informal science education (Shaffer, 2004). This work suggests productive ways that epistemic forms may be exploited in exhibit design in science museums to encourage stronger scientific conversations. However, much of the conversation at a science museum exhibit is not related to an epistemic frame--despite the intentions of exhibit designers. What other frames do parents and children use at science exhibits? Under what conditions do they enter an epistemic frame, and what are the epistemic forms suggested by exhibits? Using video, transcripts and observations of visitors at a science museum, I interpret family conversations in terms of different epistemic frames and contrast epistemic frames from other forms of interaction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:48Z (GMT).

To do this, they need rich experiences that promote such learning and mental model building. So how can we promote substantial learning in everyday, informal environments from real world practices and experiments? Museum learning and some after-school environments have addressed this issue, but in many cases, the learning can only go but so far. This paper seeks to explore how we can promote learning in these environments that can be transferred to other places and experiences. Kitchen Science Investigators (KSI) is a research endeavor, aimed at creating an after-school environment where elementary and middle school children learn from everyday experiences. This paper tells the story of the learning that occurred in this environment, pointing out activities and artifacts that worked well at both motivating and promoting learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:04:52Z (GMT).

In this study, students describe the structure of algebraic models of real-world problem situations. In one tutor version students select their descriptions from menus and in a second version students type their explanations in their own words. In a third version menu-selection and self-generation are interleaved. In this condition the canonical menu entries may serve to scaffold self-generated descriptions. Students completed the problems fastest with the menu version and the students learned to both explain and generate the target algebraic models equally well in all versions. However, the type-in version led to more successful transfer to describing novel algebraic models of problem situations. The scaffolded version was the least successful of the three.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:05:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In an adaptive simulation, the simulation environment is not fixed but rather can be modified by a tutoring agent for optimal pedagogical effect. Types of adaptations include manipulations of simulation time and state, changes in representation to facilitate explanations and/or task performance, and adjustments in simulation complexity by the addition and/or removal of components. Open research issues include how to perform these adaptations and when to employ them for optimal effect.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T19:05:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1
