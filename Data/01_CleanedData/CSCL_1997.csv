A multi-media activity (Builder) was designed to allow a pair of players to build a house together, each working from their own computer. Features of the activity include: interactive graphical interface, two- and three-dimensional views, sound feedback, and real-time written and spoken communication. Mathematical concepts, including area, perimeter, volume, and tiling of surfaces, are embedded in the task. A field study with 134 elementary school children was undertaken to assess the learning and collaborative potential of the activity. Specifically the study addressed how different modes of communication and different task directives affected learning, interpersonal attitudes, and the perceived value and enjoyment of the task. It was found that playing led to academic gains in the target math areas, and that the nature of how the task was specified significantly impacted the size of the gains. The mode of communication was found to affect attitudes towards the game and the player's partner. Gender differences were found in attitude to game, communication and partner.","Parallel Session

This isolation from their peers, eliminates the possibilities for social learning through observation, and constrains designers' growth to individual reflection on their own practice. While professional growth through reflective practice is ubiquitous, there are a number of known difficulties that constrain the amount of growth. Because routine expertise is tacit, it is difficult for designers to articulate the thinking that supports their routine practices. Without articulation, reflection cannot proceed.

One important feature of such environments is the extent to which students are able to collaborate with teachers, experts with their peers without losing control away their control of their own learning process. This paper looks at the architectural design studio as a model for dealing with this balance between control and collaboration in open-endedlearning. In particular, this paper looks at using computers to create a ""mathematics studio"" where students learn mathematics using the pedagogy of the design studio. The paper presents two studies: one of how the design studio provides a model for collaborative work, the other exploring the use of computers to adapt the studio model to mathematics learning. 'Ihese two studies show that the design studio can provide an effective model for thinking about collaboration through design activities, and that the design studio model can be used successfully in mathematics learning with the help of computer technology. This research also suggests that whatever model we take for supporting collaborative activities, students' experiences of collaboration strongly influenced by their senseof control over their learning process.

Although CSCL does not yet have widespread use in the classroom, laboratory studies of the kind we present here can shed light on how teachers can benefit from CSCL environments designed to encourage reflection on their own professional practice. While much is known about how teachers intervene in traditional classroom and tutoring settings (e.g. Douglas, 1991, Fox, 1993, Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975), less research has been carried out on tutoring interactions in computer mediated situations. The generic CSCL environment ConNeCT (Confrontation Negotiation and Construction of Text) was specially designed to promote discussion on a meta-cognitive level (cf. between students performing a collaborative text production task. We chose the domain of sound propagation for our study. We show how ConNeCT can provide teachers with a way of (i) studying the process by which students collaboratively solve problems in our chosen domain and (ii) reflecting on their own activity. We thus address the following questions within our structured CSCL environment : (1) how do teachers analyze students' collaborative problem solving activity in preparation for tutoring?, (2) how do teachers tutor collaborating dyads? and (3) what is the relation between (1) and (2)? Our study was designed to answer these questions by analyzing a teacher's annotations of a series of CSCL interaction traces and asking for clarifications through interviews and by automatically tracing to file the ensuing on-line teacher-student-student trilogue tutoring sessions in order to compare the teacher's annotations and goals with what actually happened during the trilogues. The first part of our study took place in the classroom where the students were shown a film on sound and asked to write a descriptive text of a situation concerning two tambourines. On a subsequent day in the laboratory, pairs of students carried out the remaining problem-solving in three phases within the context of ConNeCT. In phase 1, the students expressed their opinions for their own and their partner's text. In phase 2, the students discussed their texts and produced a common text. Then in phase 3, after having analyzed the interaction trace, the teacher tutored the students. We present an analysis of how teachers analyze collaborative problem-solving interaction traces issued from ConNeCT. We use an example trilogue sequence along with an interaction trace annotated by a teacher to illustrate that despite appearances of the students' final solution, the trace permitted the teacher to see they had not understood an element crucial to the description of sound and therefore was able to tutor them accordingly. We conclude that teachers can gain knowledge on students' conceptions by studying collaborative problem-solving interaction traces and that introducing teachers to a CSCL environment such as ConNeCT can give them information relevant to tutoring. In future work, we intend to explore the use of CSCL environments for promoting reflection on the part of teachers.","Posters","cscl,environment,provide,new,opportunity,make,new,demand,teacher,well,learner,although,cscl,yet,widespread,use,classroom,laboratory,study,kind,present,shed,light,teacher,benefit,cscl,environment,designed,encourage,reflection,professional,practice,much,known,teacher,intervene,traditional,classroom,tutoring,setting,e.g,douglas,1991,fox,1993,sinclair,coulthard,1975,le,research,carried,tutoring,interaction,computer,mediated,situation,generic,cscl,environment,connect,confrontation,negotiation,construction,text,specially,designed,promote,discussion,meta-cognitive,level,cf,student,performing,collaborative,text,production,task,chose,domain,sound,propagation,study,show,connect,provide,teacher,way,studying,process,student,collaboratively,solve,problem,chosen,domain,ii,reflecting,activity,thus,address,following,question,within,structured,cscl,environment,1,teacher,analyze,student,collaborative,problem,solving,activity,preparation,tutoring,2,teacher,tutor,collaborating,dyad,3,relation,1,2,study,designed,answer,question,analyzing,teacher,'s,annotation,series,cscl,interaction,trace,asking,clarification,interview,automatically,tracing,file,ensuing,on-line,teacher-student-student,trilogue,tutoring,session,order,compare,teacher,'s,annotation,goal,actually,happened,trilogues,first,part,study,took,place,classroom,student,shown,film,sound,asked,write,descriptive,text,situation,concerning,two,tambourine,subsequent,day,laboratory,pair,student,carried,remaining,problem-solving,three,phase,within,context,connect,phase,1,student,expressed,opinion,partner,'s,text,phase,2,student,discussed,text,produced,common,text,phase,3,analyzed,interaction,trace,teacher,tutored,student,present,analysis,teacher,analyze,collaborative,problem-solving,interaction,trace,issued,connect,use,example,trilogue,sequence,along,interaction,trace,annotated,teacher,illustrate,despite,appearance,student,final,solution,trace,permitted,teacher,see,understood,element,crucial,description,sound,therefore,able,tutor,accordingly,conclude,teacher,gain,knowledge,student,conception,studying,collaborative,problem-solving,interaction,trace,introducing,teacher,cscl,environment,connect,give,information,relevant,tutoring,future,work,intend,explore,use,cscl,environment,promoting,reflection,part,teacher","cscl

Incorporating domain-specific strategic support in the design of these environments can make student investigations and discussions more productive by focusing them on key variables and relationships in the domain. However, interacting with these environments may not be enough to help students develop understandings and ways of communicating that are consistent with scientific views. A support system that combines interactions with these environments with teacher-student discussions in both small-group and whole-class formats provides more comprehensive support. We describe a computer-based investigation environment that incorporates domain-specific strategic support, where students investigate an episode of natural selection in the wild. The environment was used as part of a unit on evolution at a Chicago public high school. We illustrate the complementary roles of this environment and studentteacher discussions in both small-group and wholeclass formats in supporting science learning.","Parallel Session

The target environment was a computer-networked database system in which students externalize their thoughts in the form of texts or graphics, then elaborate their thoughts by structuring with links or by commenting. Thirty students in a 5th- and 6thgrade combined classroom participated in this study as part of their regular curriculum. The students studied ""how heat affects matters."" Contents of their discourse in the database were evaluated by two independent raters from the perspective of whether critical conceptual changes happened in the students' explanations, then the students were divided into High Conceptual Change (HCC) learners and Naive learners. Further, the same contents were evaluated by two other independent raters from the perspectives of (1) what types of explanations the students generated, and (2) how they applied their explanations across different problem contexts. Results showed that HCC learners generated more explanations and more frequently used their explanations across multiple contexts, particularly ones which they had studied before CSILE sessions. A further case analysis manifested critical differences in the movement in the problem space between a HCC and a Naive learner after generating a new type of explanations. The HCC learner used the type of explanations across contexts in which they had rich information, whereas the Naive learner did not. Thus, explanation-based exploration and progressive learning in knowledge-rich contexts were found to be crucial to deeper conceptual understanding.","Parallel Session

Jonassen (1995) recommends using a variety of CMC media to support multiple facets of meaningful knowledge construction. This poster presents an analysis of communication patterns of a class of 22 students, mainly seniors and graduate students, interacting within two CMC environments. The first is an electronic bulletin board to which students could post comments about readings or class discussions over the course of the semester. The second environment is a synchronous chat session. Students in a lab received one of four handouts that designated them as members of a particular electronic discussion group. Each group had to discuss a certain issue and give a presentation, as a group, to the entire class later that day. The members of each group used pseudonyms, so they were unaware of the identities of those with whom they were interacting.","Posters","technology,fall,rubric,computer-mediated,communication,consist,diverse,array,electronic,tool,tool,power,amplify,reduce,different,element,human,interaction,bower,1988,thereby,influencing,collaborative,process,jonassen,1995,recommends,using,variety,cmc,medium,support,multiple,facet,meaningful,knowledge,construction,poster,present,analysis,communication,pattern,class,22,student,mainly,senior,graduate,student,interacting,within,two,cmc,environment,first,electronic,bulletin,board,student,could,post,comment,reading,class,discussion,course,semester,second,environment,synchronous,chat,session,student,lab,received,one,four,handout,designated,member,particular,electronic,discussion,group,group,discus,certain,issue,give,presentation,group,entire,class,later,day,member,group,used,pseudonym,unaware,identity,interacting","technology fall,fall rubric,rubric computer-mediated,computer-mediated communication,communication consist,consist diverse,diverse array,array electronic,electronic tool,tool tool,tool power,power amplify,amplify reduce,reduce different,different element,element human,human interaction,interaction bower,bower 1988,1988 thereby,thereby influencing,influencing collaborative,collaborative process,process jonassen,jonassen 1995,1995 recommends,recommends using,using variety,variety cmc,cmc medium,medium support,support multiple,multiple facet,facet meaningful,meaningful knowledge,knowledge construction,construction poster,poster present,present analysis,analysis communication,communication pattern,pattern class,class 22,22 student,student mainly,mainly senior,senior graduate,graduate student,student interacting,interacting within,within two,two cmc,cmc environment,environment first,first electronic,electronic bulletin,bulletin board,board student,student could,could post,post comment,comment reading,reading class,class discussion,discussion course,course semester,semester second,second environment,environment synchronous,synchronous chat,chat session,session student,student lab,lab received,received one,one four,four handout,handout designated,designated member,member particular,particular electronic,electronic discussion,discussion group,group group,group discus,discus certain,certain issue,issue give,give presentation,presentation group,group entire,entire class,class later,later day,day member,member group,group used,used pseudonym,pseudonym unaware,unaware identity,identity interacting","technology fall rubric,fall rubric computer-mediated,rubric computer-mediated communication,computer-mediated communication consist,communication consist diverse,consist diverse array,diverse array electronic,array electronic tool,electronic tool tool,tool tool power,tool power amplify,power amplify reduce,amplify reduce different,reduce different element,different element human,element human interaction,human interaction bower,interaction bower 1988,bower 1988 thereby,1988 thereby influencing,thereby influencing collaborative,influencing collaborative process,collaborative process jonassen,process jonassen 1995,jonassen 1995 recommends,1995 recommends using,recommends using variety,using variety cmc,variety cmc medium,cmc medium support,medium support multiple,support multiple facet,multiple facet meaningful,facet meaningful knowledge,meaningful knowledge construction,knowledge construction poster,construction poster present,poster present analysis,present analysis communication,analysis communication pattern,communication pattern class,pattern class 22,class 22 student,22 student mainly,student mainly senior,mainly senior graduate,senior graduate student,graduate student interacting,student interacting within,interacting within two,within two cmc,two cmc environment,cmc environment first,environment first electronic,first electronic bulletin,electronic bulletin board,bulletin board student,board student could,student could post,could post comment,post comment reading,comment reading class,reading class discussion,class discussion course,discussion course semester,course semester second,semester second environment,second environment synchronous,environment synchronous chat,synchronous chat session,chat session student,session student lab,student lab received,lab received one,received one four,one four handout,four handout designated,handout designated member,designated member particular,member particular electronic,particular electronic discussion,electronic discussion group,discussion group group,group group discus,group discus certain,discus certain issue,certain issue give,issue give presentation,give presentation group,presentation group entire,group entire class,entire class later,class later day,later day member,day member group,member group used,group used pseudonym,used pseudonym unaware,pseudonym unaware identity,unaware identity interacting"

Through longitudinal observations of a music group learning to cover (i.e., play) other groups’ songs, and an analysis of the computational requirements for song covering, we show how simultaneous group activity creates — as a sideeffect — emergent structures that can sequence individual behavior. In short, local activity creates global cues that can then direct local action. We argue that this is not specific to music groups, but that global cues emerge in any simultaneous group activity in which individuals have access to others' on-going performances.

The results indicate that gesturing has an important role to play when subjects are discussing collisions since they use their hands to denote speed and force of an impact. More surprisingly, however, gesturing was also associated with problem solving success when subjects were supporting one another with very positive feedback and also when disagreements arose between them. Mutual gesturing also impacted upon the planning process of the investigation. However, more mutual gesturing and gazing occurred with female pairs rather than male and mixed gender dyads. Problem solving success also correlated with gaze which again was associated with cognitive planning and the provision of positive and negative feedback among partners. To conclude our main finding is that differences in non-verbal communication strategies effect not only the strategies that progress the collaborative process but more importantly also those that influence the understanding of the problem space. These results suggest the quality of video linkage will play an important role in collaborative solving for distance learners.","Parallel Session

Th e tool allows operators to co-construct an interactive hyper media model of the physical production environment, including controls for manual operation. By describing current status for a number of reactor systems, problem situations based on real or invented cases can also be modeled by the operators for later simulation . Annotations describing e.g. known equipment problems can be linked to production machinery in the model, and a search facility for the annotations is provided .

The students used two different software packages to make two different movies. This experiment demonstrated that students, given adequate support, can quickly learn to use the technology and can make their first movie in as little as 5 hours. When we focused on the quality of their movies and on the moviemaking process, we discovered great variability in these areas. Learning effect was great, the second movies were significantly better than the first. More time spent in the idea development led to movies of higher quality.

The first step in the development of the POLARIS-application was a comprehensive analysis by a survey among students and teachers of the learning activities in the two curricula. The results of this study, in combination with a review of experiences with electronic learning environments elsewhere as well as a review of relevant learning theories, were the input for the formulation of the user requirements of POLARIS. The second step was the development of the functional design and the prototype.

In that short span, however, the team of researchers has developed eight different prototype software systems and evaluated them in a variety of settings with middle school, undergraduate, and graduate students. In this paper, we reflect on some of the overall lessons learned through this work. We have developed an approach to instruction that involves students' learning through solving real-world problems. We help students manage the complexity of these problems in several ways. First, we use the methodology from problem-based learning (PBL) to help students structure their problem-solving. Second, we provide students with case libraries to help them learn from the experience of others. Third, we provide support for student reflection. Part of these ideas developed out of the close fit that we saw between the PBL educational methodology and the cognitive model derived from case-based reasoning [1]. Later work has focused on merging what we know about the design process with the PBL classroom methodology.","Parallel Session Papers","research,computer-supported,collaborative,learning,edutech,institute,georgia,tech,relatively,new,le,five,year,old,short,span,however,team,researcher,developed,eight,different,prototype,software,system,evaluated,variety,setting,middle,school,undergraduate,graduate,student,paper,reflect,overall,lesson,learned,work,developed,approach,instruction,involves,student,learning,solving,real-world,problem,help,student,manage,complexity,problem,several,way,first,use,methodology,problem-based,learning,pbl,help,student,structure,problem-solving,second,provide,student,case,library,help,learn,experience,others,third,provide,support,student,reflection,part,idea,developed,close,fit,saw,pbl,educational,methodology,cognitive,model,derived,case-based,reasoning,1,later,work,focused,merging,know,design,process,pbl,classroom,methodology","research computer-supported,computer-supported collaborative,collaborative learning,learning edutech,edutech institute,institute georgia,georgia tech,tech relatively,relatively new,new le,le five,five year,year old,old short,short span,span however,however team,team researcher,researcher developed,developed eight,eight different,different prototype,prototype software,software system,system evaluated,evaluated variety,variety setting,setting middle,middle school,school undergraduate,undergraduate graduate,graduate student,student paper,paper reflect,reflect overall,overall lesson,lesson learned,learned work,work developed,developed approach,approach instruction,instruction involves,involves student,student learning,learning solving,solving real-world,real-world problem,problem help,help student,student manage,manage complexity,complexity problem,problem several,several way,way first,first use,use methodology,methodology problem-based,problem-based learning,learning pbl,pbl help,help student,student structure,structure problem-solving,problem-solving second,second provide,provide student,student case,case library,library help,help learn,learn experience,experience others,others third,third provide,provide support,support student,student reflection,reflection part,part idea,idea developed,developed close,close fit,fit saw,saw pbl,pbl educational,educational methodology,methodology cognitive,cognitive model,model derived,derived case-based,case-based reasoning,reasoning 1,1 later,later work,work focused,focused merging,merging know,know design,design process,process pbl,pbl classroom,classroom methodology","research computer-supported collaborative,computer-supported collaborative learning,collaborative learning edutech,learning edutech institute,edutech institute georgia,institute georgia tech,georgia tech relatively,tech relatively new,relatively new le,new le five,le five year,five year old,year old short,old short span,short span however,span however team,however team researcher,team researcher developed,researcher developed eight,developed eight different,eight different prototype,different prototype software,prototype software system,software system evaluated,system evaluated variety,evaluated variety setting,variety setting middle,setting middle school,middle school undergraduate,school undergraduate graduate,undergraduate graduate student,graduate student paper,student paper reflect,paper reflect overall,reflect overall lesson,overall lesson learned,lesson learned work,learned work developed,work developed approach,developed approach instruction,approach instruction involves,instruction involves student,involves student learning,student learning solving,learning solving real-world,solving real-world problem,real-world problem help,problem help student,help student manage,student manage complexity,manage complexity problem,complexity problem several,problem several way,several way first,way first use,first use methodology,use methodology problem-based,methodology problem-based learning,problem-based learning pbl,learning pbl help,pbl help student,help student structure,student structure problem-solving,structure problem-solving second,problem-solving second provide,second provide student,provide student case,student case library,case library help,library help learn,help learn experience,learn experience others,experience others third,others third provide,third provide support,provide support student,support student reflection,student reflection part,reflection part idea,part idea developed,idea developed close,developed close fit,close fit saw,fit saw pbl,saw pbl educational,pbl educational methodology,educational methodology cognitive,methodology cognitive model,cognitive model derived,model derived case-based,derived case-based reasoning,case-based reasoning 1,reasoning 1 later,1 later work,later work focused,work focused merging,focused merging know,merging know design,know design process,design process pbl,process pbl classroom,pbl classroom methodology"

TAPPED IN integrates synchronous and asynchronous communication, document storage and sharing, and interaction with virtual objects in a venue patterned after a real-world conference center. Teachers can log into TAPPED IN to share Web resources, hold meetings and workshops, engage in mentoring, and conduct collaborative inquiries with the aid of familiar discoursesupport artifacts such as whiteboards, file cabinets, and bulletin boards. Our WWW user interface and joint-Web-browsing capabilities enable teachers to collaborate more effectively in the presence of Web-based resources. Users who have a Web browser that supports Java Telnet applets can connect to TAPPED IN through their Web browser by using our Java applet, TAPestry, which combines a live Telnet connection with a browser window. TAPestry allows users to project (or ""push"") a Web page to another user's Web browser. Unlike most MUVEs, TAPPED IN can accept email to TAPPED IN users from the Internet and to allow members to send, reply to, and forward email from TAPPED IN to any external email address. We have also developed a variety of data collection protocols and tools to automatically log usage data and transcripts of activities. Results of a pilot test indicate that teachers can learn to use TAPestry for Website tours in less than an hour and that satisfaction with the capability is high. The poster will illustrate TAPPED IN design and show vignettes of how it is being used.","Posters","shared,need,meaningful,on-line,interactivity,supported,web,page,listservs,motivated,several,k-12,tpd,organization,join,sri,developing,teacher,professional,development,institute,tapped,platformindependent,web-aware,multi-user,virtual,environment,muve,tapped,integrates,synchronous,asynchronous,communication,document,storage,sharing,interaction,virtual,object,venue,patterned,real-world,conference,center,teacher,log,tapped,share,web,resource,hold,meeting,workshop,engage,mentoring,conduct,collaborative,inquiry,aid,familiar,discoursesupport,artifact,whiteboards,file,cabinet,bulletin,board,www,user,interface,joint-web-browsing,capability,enable,teacher,collaborate,effectively,presence,web-based,resource,user,web,browser,support,java,telnet,applet,connect,tapped,web,browser,using,java,applet,tapestry,combine,live,telnet,connection,browser,window,tapestry,allows,user,project,``,push,'',web,page,another,user,'s,web,browser,unlike,muves,tapped,accept,email,tapped,user,internet,allow,member,send,reply,forward,email,tapped,external,email,address,also,developed,variety,data,collection,protocol,tool,automatically,log,usage,data,transcript,activity,result,pilot,test,indicate,teacher,learn,use,tapestry,website,tour,le,hour,satisfaction,capability,high,poster,illustrate,tapped,design,show,vignette,used","shared

This poster focuses on a component of a software framework that helps build knowledge communities by capitalizing on the multiple perspectives available within any population. The framework structures an array of resources that encourage learners to reflect on what they know and to contrast it with other people’s perspectives. It organizes the resources through a cyclical process of inquiry and problem solving that follows these steps: the presentation of a challenge, generating ideas, viewing multiple perspectives, doing research, testing your mettle, and finally “going public” by publishing what you’ve learned. An authoring environment called STAR Legacy (Software Technology for Action and Reflection) provides a vehicle for “learning designers” to structure various media resources that support a learner’s thinking during the process of exploring a particular challenge. In this presentation we emphasize how multiple perspectives bring together experts and

Pervading these constructs is the understanding that IT can be used as an ideological agent, which is crucial if we are to connect theoretical foundations with practice.

It provides children with the opportunity to explore mathematics as one of many symbol systems that have been built for the purposes of communication. We designed a sequence of four two-person games centered on the theme of codes and secret messages and conducted formative evaluation of the games. By pairing tools for the creation of codes and authoring of coded messages with a full featured email messaging system, KidCode enables children to gain experience with many kinds of symbolic representations. Message authoring can consist of text, graphics, and even animations. Similarly, with KidCode children can advance from an understanding of symbolic representation of object/noun type entities for text and simple pictures to coded representations of spatial relationships and, finally, to representation of operator actions. Our work provides an example of how mathematics instruction can be based on the use of email software to structure cooperative interactions among elementary aged students. For formative studies, we crafted materials of paper and poster board with varied examples at different levels of difficulty that could be used for multiple rounds of play. These materials were used throughout the research period in evaluations with three adults and twenty children in the first through fourth grades (ages 5-10 yrs.) from a wide range of socioeconomic backgrounds. As the research progressed, the materials were revised or expanded in order to address issues that arose during the evaluation sessions. Some of the games were modified considerably after observing children play the games. Our research suggests that, taken together, the games improve the children’s facility with symbolic processing. In this paper we describe one of the KidCode games - Rebus - in detail. We explain how formative evaluation based on paper materials was used to test design ideas for the KidCode software and develop a sequence of games to scaffold children’s understanding of symbol systems and that would work effectively in an electronic mail context. The figure on the cover page shows the email inbox from a screen dump of a Macromedia Director1 prototype of the software. The bus icon indicates a Rebus game message.","Parallel Session

Such organizations face constant change and the corresponding need for continual learning and renewal of their workers. In this paper we describe a system called PHelpS (Peer Help System) that facilitates workers in carrying out such “life long learning”. When a worker runs into difficulty in carrying out a task, PHelpS provides a list of other workers who are ready, willing and able to help him or her. The worker then selects a particular helper with PHelpS supporting the subsequent help interaction. The PHelpS system acts as a facilitator to stimulate learning and collaboration, rather than as a directive agent imposing its perspectives on the workers.","Parallel Session Papers","increasingly,organization,geographically,distributed,activity,coordinated,integrated,use,information,technology,organization,face,constant,change,corresponding,need,continual,learning,renewal,worker,paper,describe,system,called,phelps,peer,help,system,facilitates,worker,carrying,“,life,long,learning,”,worker,run,difficulty,carrying,task,phelps,provides,list,worker,ready,willing,able,help,worker,selects,particular,helper,phelps,supporting,subsequent,help,interaction,phelps,system,act,facilitator,stimulate,learning,collaboration,rather,directive,agent,imposing,perspective,worker","increasingly organization,organization geographically,geographically distributed,distributed activity,activity coordinated,coordinated integrated,integrated use,use information,information technology,technology organization,organization face,face constant,constant change,change corresponding,corresponding need,need continual,continual learning,learning renewal,renewal worker,worker paper,paper describe,describe system,system called,called phelps,phelps peer,peer help,help system,system facilitates,facilitates worker,worker carrying,carrying “,“ life,life long,long learning,learning ”,” worker,worker run,run difficulty,difficulty carrying,carrying task,task phelps,phelps provides,provides list,list worker,worker ready,ready willing,willing able,able help,help worker,worker selects,selects particular,particular helper,helper phelps,phelps supporting,supporting subsequent,subsequent help,help interaction,interaction phelps,phelps system,system act,act facilitator,facilitator stimulate,stimulate learning,learning collaboration,collaboration rather,rather directive,directive agent,agent imposing,imposing perspective,perspective worker","increasingly organization geographically,organization geographically distributed,geographically distributed activity,distributed activity coordinated,activity coordinated integrated,coordinated integrated use,integrated use information,use information technology,information technology organization,technology organization face,organization face constant,face constant change,constant change corresponding,change corresponding need,corresponding need continual,need continual learning,continual learning renewal,learning renewal worker,renewal worker paper,worker paper describe,paper describe system,describe system called,system called phelps,called phelps peer,phelps peer help,peer help system,help system facilitates,system facilitates worker,facilitates worker carrying,worker carrying “,carrying “ life,“ life long,life long learning,long learning ”,learning ” worker,” worker run,worker run difficulty,run difficulty carrying,difficulty carrying task,carrying task phelps,task phelps provides,phelps provides list,provides list worker,list worker ready,worker ready willing,ready willing able,willing able help,able help worker,help worker selects,worker selects particular,selects particular helper,particular helper phelps,helper phelps supporting,phelps supporting subsequent,supporting subsequent help,subsequent help interaction,help interaction phelps,interaction phelps system,phelps system act,system act facilitator,act facilitator stimulate,facilitator stimulate learning,stimulate learning collaboration,learning collaboration rather,collaboration rather directive,rather directive agent,directive agent imposing,agent imposing perspective,imposing perspective worker"

Situated learning (Lave & Wenger, 1991) provides a theoretical basis for the model. According to this theory, learning is situated in activity, context, and culture. Through social interaction and collaboration, learners become engaged in a community of practice. This practice includes activities involving interaction with others, interaction with artifacts as representations of ideas (e.g., papers, projects, videos, concept maps), and interaction with artifacts which mediate communication and creation and manipulation of representations. In the context of online learning, computers mediate communication and manipulation of representational artifacts. This means that researchers and reflective practitioners have a unique opportunity to access the interactions of learners. For example, computer conferencing systems produce transcripts of the discourse which can then be evaluated. Criteria for evaluation of the online learning experience include critical thinking, collaboration, and knowledge building. For example, is there evidence of critical dialogic engagement? A central issue in each of these criteria is the process learners become engaged in as they produce representations of their understandings. Further, design of the learning activity shapes that process. Therefore, a requirement of the model is that it address instructional design, process, and outcomes. The goal of the model is to provide a means for synthesizing examination of the online learning experience from different perspectives. Two case studies are presented in which the model has been applied. One case involved a graduate course, the other an undergraduate course. The technology used to deliver the courses was Virtual-U, a web-based networked learning environment to support collaboration and knowledge building. We conclude with an assessment of some of the implications of the model and future modifications of the model.","Posters","poster,model,presented,evaluating,online,learning,situated,learning,lave,wenger,1991,provides,theoretical,basis,model,according,theory,learning,situated,activity,context,culture,social,interaction,collaboration,learner,become,engaged,community,practice,practice,includes,activity,involving,interaction,others,interaction,artifact,representation,idea,e.g.,paper,project,video,concept,map,interaction,artifact,mediate,communication,creation,manipulation,representation,context,online,learning,computer,mediate,communication,manipulation,representational,artifact,mean,researcher,reflective,practitioner,unique,opportunity,access,interaction,learner,example,computer,conferencing,system,produce,transcript,discourse,evaluated,criterion,evaluation,online,learning,experience,include,critical,thinking,collaboration,knowledge,building,example,evidence,critical,dialogic,engagement,central,issue,criterion,process,learner,become,engaged,produce,representation,understanding,design,learning,activity,shape,process,therefore,requirement,model,address,instructional,design,process,outcome,goal,model,provide,mean,synthesizing,examination,online,learning,experience,different,perspective,two,case,study,presented,model,applied,one,case,involved,graduate,course,undergraduate,course,technology,used,deliver,course,virtual-u,web-based,networked,learning,environment,support,collaboration,knowledge,building,conclude,assessment,implication,model,future,modification,model","poster

Its case-authoring component, when used as part of the LBD curriculum, asks students to reflect on a recent Learning-by-Design experience, summarize it, and present important aspects of it and what they've learned from it for other students to learn from. By focusing on this part of the tool, we are able to both put our focus on supporting reflection and collect a library of student-authored cases that we will later edit and publish as exemplary cases for other students to use as models and to learn from. JavaCAP is meant to be used as a collaboration tool. Supporting collaboration in middle school requires supporting both group work around the computer (synchronous collaboration) and asynchronous editing of cases. We support asynchronous collaboration by allowing each student to write on the case and providing distinguishing formats for each so it is easy to see the changes made since last using the tool and identify whose changes they are. Our two studies suggest that JavaCAP does have potential as a collaborative reflection tool. We've used the metaphor of scenes in a play to help students remember different aspects of the experience they are analyzing and summarizing. Our first pilot showed that we had indeed found a way to engage students in effective reflection. However, this pilot also revealed flaws in the underlying technology. We needed to support asynchronous collaboration better than we were doing; the easiest way to do this was to reimplement using what the world wide web and its development tools had to offer.

In communicating the process of software development and analysis that went into the Mission to Mars Webliographer, we use a framework first proposed by Koschmann et al. (1996). This framework is a four step model which articulates the desired instructional features of the tool, analyzes current practice in light of design goals, develops a specialization for the tool based on both the instructional requirements of the setting and the known capabilities of the technology, and produces an implementation that allows for adaptation to instructional practice. Preliminary findings indicate that the Mission to Mars Webliographer is an effective tool for time management issues concerning student research in project-based classrooms utilizing the Internet. In addition, teacher interviews and classroom observations indicate that student’s Internet use is more focused and on-task when utilizing the Mission to Mars Webliographer as opposed to more

Our observations of groups involved in Problem-Based Learning (PBL) scenarios suggest a need to support two separate organizations of information. First is the conversation, a temporally-organized interaction which closely resembles unmoderated face-to-face interaction. Conversations place a value on speed, a sense of moving the conversation forward, relevant anecdotes, and a holistic assessment of the problem and serve as an appropriate forum for brainstorming, problem definition, socializing/synergy-building, and exploratory interactions. Lengthy focus on a specific issue, though, is difficult. Issuebased discussion takes place in conferences organized hierarchically (in an outline form). This provides not only the structures necessary to conduct topic-by-topic exploration, but affords students the opportunity to easily track the history of discussion on an individual

The authors propose a ‘body metaphor’ concept, which follows the ordinary body arrangement in everyday instruction. It allows: (1) to display instructor’s pointer; (2) to display instructor’s face; (3) to display views of learner’s orientation; (4) to arouse learner’s awareness of being watched by the instructor; and (5) to dispose communication resources apart enough so as to clarify the learner’s orientation. Comparative experiments revealed that body metaphor setting supported smoother collaboration than the conventional face-to-face metaphor setting.","Plenary Session Papers","optimum,arrangement,communication,resource,distance,education,system,support,collaborative,learning,including,hand-manipulation,physical,object,empirically,investigated,author,propose,‘,body,metaphor,’,concept,follows,ordinary,body,arrangement,everyday,instruction,allows,1,display,instructor,’,pointer,2,display,instructor,’,face,3,display,view,learner,’,orientation,4,arouse,learner,’,awareness,watched,instructor,5,dispose,communication,resource,apart,enough,clarify,learner,’,orientation,comparative,experiment,revealed,body,metaphor,setting,supported,smoother,collaboration,conventional,face-to-face,metaphor,setting","optimum arrangement,arrangement communication,communication resource,resource distance,distance education,education system,system support,support collaborative,collaborative learning,learning including,including hand-manipulation,hand-manipulation physical,physical object,object empirically,empirically investigated,investigated author,author propose,propose ‘,‘ body,body metaphor,metaphor ’,’ concept,concept follows,follows ordinary,ordinary body,body arrangement,arrangement everyday,everyday instruction,instruction allows,allows 1,1 display,display instructor,instructor ’,’ pointer,pointer 2,2 display,display instructor,instructor ’,’ face,face 3,3 display,display view,view learner,learner ’,’ orientation,orientation 4,4 arouse,arouse learner,learner ’,’ awareness,awareness watched,watched instructor,instructor 5,5 dispose,dispose communication,communication resource,resource apart,apart enough,enough clarify,clarify learner,learner ’,’ orientation,orientation comparative,comparative experiment,experiment revealed,revealed body,body metaphor,metaphor setting,setting supported,supported smoother,smoother collaboration,collaboration conventional,conventional face-to-face,face-to-face metaphor,metaphor setting","optimum arrangement communication,arrangement communication resource,communication resource distance,resource distance education,distance education system,education system support,system support collaborative,support collaborative learning,collaborative learning including,learning including hand-manipulation,including hand-manipulation physical,hand-manipulation physical object,physical object empirically,object empirically investigated,empirically investigated author,investigated author propose,author propose ‘,propose ‘ body,‘ body metaphor,body metaphor ’,metaphor ’ concept,’ concept follows,concept follows ordinary,follows ordinary body,ordinary body arrangement,body arrangement everyday,arrangement everyday instruction,everyday instruction allows,instruction allows 1,allows 1 display,1 display instructor,display instructor ’,instructor ’ pointer,’ pointer 2,pointer 2 display,2 display instructor,display instructor ’,instructor ’ face,’ face 3,face 3 display,3 display view,display view learner,view learner ’,learner ’ orientation,’ orientation 4,orientation 4 arouse,4 arouse learner,arouse learner ’,learner ’ awareness,’ awareness watched,awareness watched instructor,watched instructor 5,instructor 5 dispose,5 dispose communication,dispose communication resource,communication resource apart,resource apart enough,apart enough clarify,enough clarify learner,clarify learner ’,learner ’ orientation,’ orientation comparative,orientation comparative experiment,comparative experiment revealed,experiment revealed body,revealed body metaphor,body metaphor setting,metaphor setting supported,setting supported smoother,supported smoother collaboration,smoother collaboration conventional,collaboration conventional face-to-face,conventional face-to-face metaphor,face-to-face metaphor setting"

Mentoring involves an experienced person giving guidance, knowledge, and encouragement to someone who is learning. The benefit to mentors can be furthering one's own knowledge, the fulfillment of the desire “to make a difference,” and to make a personal connection in their communities. In this age of the Internet, innovative educators are combining the concept of mentoring with the reach and convenience of new telecommunications technology. Now, more students can become involved in a positive, collaborative relationship with a caring adult, who can provide attention, academic assistance, validation, advice, and support.

The study was aimed at analyzing how elementary school students’ process of inquiry mediated by the CSILE environment developed from first (third grade) to second (fourth grade) year of CSILE use. The study was carried out by analyzing qualitatively 26 students’ written productions in CSILE’s database as well as by conducting some structured interviews. The study indicated that the students made a considerable progress in terms of explanation-seeking research questions, explanatory level of knowledge produced by them as well as quality of discourse interaction. However, at this point of time there were no indications of in-depth knowledge advancement that characterize the most successful Canadian CSILE classes. It is argued that facilitation of higher-level practices of inquiry in the context of the CSCL require a lot of pedagogical and epistemological support for both the teachers and students. It seems also to be important to engage a whole school community to the process of pedagogical development rather than deal with individual teachers and classrooms.","Plenary Session

In this study, college dyads collaborated to learn a biology concept. Preliminary findings showed that pairs shared similar mental models and knowledge pieces after collaborative learning and that the amount of collaborative knowledge is related to the amount of learning. Such results suggest that pairs engage in shared learning activities during collaboration which seems to lead to increased learning. Ideas for further analysis are discussed as well as implications of this study for a computer support system for collaborative learning.","Plenary Session Papers","study,report,preliminary,finding,study,investigated,1,kind,extent,shared,knowledge,constructed,collaborative,learning,2,relationship,construction,shared,knowledge,individual,learning,study,college,dyad,collaborated,learn,biology,concept,preliminary,finding,showed,pair,shared,similar,mental,model,knowledge,piece,collaborative,learning,amount,collaborative,knowledge,related,amount,learning,result,suggest,pair,engage,shared,learning,activity,collaboration,seems,lead,increased,learning,idea,analysis,discussed,well,implication,study,computer,support,system,collaborative,learning","study report,report preliminary,preliminary finding,finding study,study investigated,investigated 1,1 kind,kind extent,extent shared,shared knowledge,knowledge constructed,constructed collaborative,collaborative learning,learning 2,2 relationship,relationship construction,construction shared,shared knowledge,knowledge individual,individual learning,learning study,study college,college dyad,dyad collaborated,collaborated learn,learn biology,biology concept,concept preliminary,preliminary finding,finding showed,showed pair,pair shared,shared similar,similar mental,mental model,model knowledge,knowledge piece,piece collaborative,collaborative learning,learning amount,amount collaborative,collaborative knowledge,knowledge related,related amount,amount learning,learning result,result suggest,suggest pair,pair engage,engage shared,shared learning,learning activity,activity collaboration,collaboration seems,seems lead,lead increased,increased learning,learning idea,idea analysis,analysis discussed,discussed well,well implication,implication study,study computer,computer support,support system,system collaborative,collaborative learning","study report preliminary,report preliminary finding,preliminary finding study,finding study investigated,study investigated 1,investigated 1 kind,1 kind extent,kind extent shared,extent shared knowledge,shared knowledge constructed,knowledge constructed collaborative,constructed collaborative learning,collaborative learning 2,learning 2 relationship,2 relationship construction,relationship construction shared,construction shared knowledge,shared knowledge individual,knowledge individual learning,individual learning study,learning study college,study college dyad,college dyad collaborated,dyad collaborated learn,collaborated learn biology,learn biology concept,biology concept preliminary,concept preliminary finding,preliminary finding showed,finding showed pair,showed pair shared,pair shared similar,shared similar mental,similar mental model,mental model knowledge,model knowledge piece,knowledge piece collaborative,piece collaborative learning,collaborative learning amount,learning amount collaborative,amount collaborative knowledge,collaborative knowledge related,knowledge related amount,related amount learning,amount learning result,learning result suggest,result suggest pair,suggest pair engage,pair engage shared,engage shared learning,shared learning activity,learning activity collaboration,activity collaboration seems,collaboration seems lead,seems lead increased,lead increased learning,increased learning idea,learning idea analysis,idea analysis discussed,analysis discussed well,discussed well implication,well implication study,implication study computer,study computer support,computer support system,support system collaborative,system collaborative learning"

Learning and cooperation in the Fifth Dimension are analyzed in the paper from the point of view of Activity Theory, a conceptual approach originating from Russian cultural-historical psychology. It is proposed that the mechanisms underlying the influence of social context on learning and development are mutual transformations between individual and collective activities. Three distinct phases of intersubjectivity ""life cycles"" are identified: (1) external coordination of individual activities, (2) emerging group identity, and (3) transfer of group experience to individual activities.
