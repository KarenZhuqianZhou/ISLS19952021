The value of a dialogic analytic framework including creative emergence was tested through applying it to the coding and analysis of undergraduate synchronous e-discussions using a graphical interface within the EU funded project ARGUNAUT. Qualitative analysis found that critical reasoning functioned to `deepen' the graph through unpacking assumptions whilst creative emergence of new perspectives produced `widening' moves. This distinction between deepening and widening was successfully used as the basis for an artificial intelligence (AI) graph-matching algorithm. Given examples of deepening and widening from real e-discussions, the AI algorithm was able to successfully find other occurrences of such moves within new e-discussions. This supports our claim to distinguish between these two aspects of shared thinking and has the potential to provide awareness indicators as a support for e-moderation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:04Z (GMT).

In the paper we develop a method to examine the relation between domain-related chats and learning outcome for intuitive knowledge. We describe how we automatically extract domain-related messages, and score them based on the expected cognitive effort to produce the messages. The analysis confirms that there is a positive relation between a high score on domain-related chats and the learning improvement as measured by the difference between a post-test and a pre-test on intuitive knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:06Z (GMT).

In addition, we also differentiate between students that are known to be active participants in F2F classroom discussions and those who usually remain silent. The findings highlight several advantages of CMC over F2F discussions in co-located settings and show that different students ('active' and 'silent') experience F2F and computer-mediated communication differently.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:06Z (GMT).

To investigate the learning outcome, we analyzed the joint task solutions with respect to knowledge acquisition and knowledge application. Learners were assigned to three groups who had to solve four tasks relating to the main topics on knowledge management. Results show that learning processes varied depending on the tasks and groups, but no general trend was found. Furthermore, the four task solutions also differed in their quality. The fact that learning processes were related to group products confirms the relevance of learning processes for acquiring and applying knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:07Z (GMT).

Our study measures the learners' performance on a similar task by looking at the efficiency in which that task is carried out.

These prior analyses have focused on collaborative interaction, yet for instrumental purposes in educational practice, the individual is the unit of analysis. Hence it is relevant to ask how individuals use the products of collaborative interaction as documented in a given notational system. This paper reports on an analysis of data from a prior study to uncover how participants went about writing individual essays, drawing on the products of interactionally prior joint problem solving. The analysis first documented parameters of the human-computer interactions through which individual participants accessed and appropriated the record of prior work. Parameters included focus shifts, use of copy/paste, and access to records of data and hypotheses considered. The analysis then compared three experimental conditions and two post-hoc groups on the selected parameters. Profiles plots reveal consistent differences between the use of the notational systems that are indicative of differences in engagement with the materials.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:08Z (GMT).

A sample of ninety-six secondary school students, aged 16, participated in the two-week experiment. Students were randomly paired to solve six problems about Newtonian mechanics. Their pre- and post-test performances and online interactions were analyzed. We found that female students' learning performance and knowledge elaboration process were sensitive to their partner gender, but that's not the case for male students. Besides, due to a divergent knowledge elaboration process, mixed-gender dyads run the risk of disadvantaging female students in CSCL.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:08Z (GMT).

We argue that the effectiveness of collaboration may depend on the type of knowledge the instruction targets: The interaction with a partner can slow down students and may thus decrease the amount of practice necessary for procedural skill fluency. On the other hand, collaboration could be particularly useful for conceptual knowledge acquisition, as here, the elaborative meaning- making activities ascribed to collaboration may facilitate learning. To evaluate the differential effects of collaborative learning, we compared four conditions: individual versus collaborative learning with procedural instruction, and individual versus collaborative learning with conceptual instruction. The study results support our hypotheses: Students who learned individually showed higher test scores in a procedural far transfer test. However, a combination test requiring both knowledge types revealed a positive impact of collaboration on students' conceptual knowledge acquisition.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:09Z (GMT).

We trace the formation, transformation and refinement of one problem- solving practice--problem decomposition--and three representational practices--inscribe first solve second, modulate perspective and visualize decomposition. The analysis shows how inscriptions become representations for the group through a historical trajectory of negotiation. This result is of theoretical interest because it shows how the practices underlying group cognition are contingent upon not only the immediate situation but also the chronologically prior resources and associated practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:09Z (GMT).

Research on instruction suggests four interrelated processes that jointly lead to integrated understanding: eliciting current ideas, adding new ideas, evaluating ideas, and sorting out ideas. These processes characterize design patterns that promote knowledge integration. We describe how knowledge integration patterns informed the design of collaborative activities for Chemical Reactions and report on the value of heterogeneity in small groups. We describe how teachers learned from each other while refining an on-line teacher's guide for Asthma.

We propose a new framework - the collaborative scientific conceptual change model to stresses the importance of high quality collaborative discourse and scientific epistemic practices in the process of conceptual change. To investigate how group interactions influence individual students' learning gains, multilevel analysis was used to analyze the hierarchically nested data and qualitative analyses were presented to compare high and low-achievement groups' discourse and their application of epistemic practices. The results found that predicting and coordinating theory and evidence were key practices that predicted students' individual posttest performance and the group interactions were related to the group understanding.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:09Z (GMT).

The goal of the research was to provide empirical support for a recent model of learning and instruction that blends the two perspectives of knowledge communities and scaffolded inquiry. A design-oriented method was employed, where the first iteration of the curriculum was evaluated in terms of its fit to the model, as well as its impact on student learning. Based on a set of design recommendations, a much more substantive curriculum was developed for the second iteration, leading to rich measures of student collaboration and deep understanding of the targeted science concepts. This paper describes our co-design process, which allowed teachers to lead the curriculum design and classroom enactment while researchers contributed design guidelines according to the theoretical model.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:10Z (GMT).

For the past 5 years, significant research has been undertaken in order to better understand the organization of such forums, the activity of participants and groups, and the evolution of discourse and so on, involving very different tools and methods. This text provides a guided tour of these research efforts, explaining their importance and putting the main results obtained into perspective.

The paper focuses on claims about the Net generation's relationship to collaboration and cooperation and the ways that this relationship is associated with technological rather than social processes. Based on a survey of first year students in five universities across a range of subjects and disciplinary areas, the paper concludes that we should be cautious about the claims that have been made about Net generation learners. It suggests that broad brush approaches to generational changes obscure the subtle but important differences between students. It also suggests that claims that there has been a step change in attitudes takes attention away from the kinds of choices that might be necessary in relation to variations that are indeed taking place amongst new cohorts of students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:11Z (GMT).

The results indicate that intrinsic motivation was significantly correlated with students' elaboration processes and knowledge transfer. However, no significant correlation was observed between intrinsic motivation and students' moderation behaviors. The findings suggest that instructional designers and teachers in online classes should integrate strategies to promote students' motivation, and more importantly, they should scaffold student moderators to achieve meaningful learning in peer-moderated online discussions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:11Z (GMT).

This study examines a process of integration of a technological tool, to which a group of teachers participated. The technological tool was developed to enhance dialogism and argumentation, in one Grade 9 class. The question we focused on concerns whether the technological tool used by each teacher for a specific subject matter became integrated in teaching and learning practice across disciplines. Data included 22 discussion maps in five activities by different teachers. The analysis focuses on two dimensions of use of the technological tool: its form and its function. The findings show a process of appropriation of the technological tool could be detected along the five activities. This appropriation could be seen through the increase of arguments and challenges, the growing reference to each other's ideas, and capitalization of previous arguments in follow-up arguments. The results of this study stress the importance of the participation of teachers in the same teacher training and shows that appropriation of norms afforded by a tool are instigated by their participation in two activity systems stimulated by the same technological tool.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:12Z (GMT).

The increased financial burden for these institutions and the enhanced task burden for teachers working with small groups of students threaten the quality of teaching and learning. In order to cope with this situation, computer-mediated collaboration (telecollaboration) was used to provide teachers with the opportunity to work with colleagues from other colleges who teach similar courses. In this short paper, the impacts of telecollaboration on resources diversity and teacher professional development are examined. After four semesters of experimentation, questionnaires and interviews suggest that teachers learned from their colleagues as they shared ideas and acquired pedagogical and technopedagogical knowledge and skills.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:12Z (GMT).

We have used the complex systems concept of adaptation as a lens for understanding how and why some teachers are better able to adapt to the educational program requirements. The results show that processes of convergence and non-convergence influenced adaptive outcomes, and that the more similar the teaching characteristic index (TCI) number was between group members, the more likely it was that group dynamics would result in convergent adaptive outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:13Z (GMT).

New models for knowledge creation, accumulation, and sharing are needed that allow, encourage, and support all participants to be active contributors in personally meaningful activities. In our research, we have explored and contrasted two different models: MODEL-AUTHORITATIVE (based on strong input filters, relatively small information repositories, and weak output filters) and MODEL-DEMOCRATIC (based on weak input filters, large and diverse information repositories, and strong output filters to find relevant and reliable information). We postulate that MODEL-DEMOCRATIC democratizes design, requires support for meta-design, and fosters social creativity thereby creating new challenges and opportunities for computer-supported collaborative learning. Examples from different lifelong learning settings based on MODEL-DEMOCRATIC are described and analyzed and some general findings are derived and discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:13Z (GMT).

In contrast to public communities, an official organization like a company consists of rather formal structures which define what a member should do and how to fulfill a task by assigning a role. If such a formal organization supports a community, does the balance between informal and formal structures will change? This short paper presents the results of a field study about a socio-technical community called `InPUD' which is part of a faculty. The main conclusion is that a specific degree of digital formalization in online groups is needed for successful online structures and sustainability. By using new media like Web 2.0, the balance between informal and formal structures in institutions will be changed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:14Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It is maintained that typical functionalities in existing educational web- technologies, such as various Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), are quite inflexible and inadequate for shared work on epistemic objects.

The need for participants to coordinate their actions becomes particularly salient in dual-interaction environments, where, e.g., chat postings and graphical drawings must work together; analysts of such interactions must identify the subtle and complex ways in which meaning making proceeds. This paper considers the methodological requirements on analyzing interaction in dual-interaction environments by reviewing several exemplary CSCL studies. It reflects on the nature of social organization, grounding and indexicality that frame the interaction to be analyzed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The personal devices that are applied in a manner without interoperation with appropriate peripherals may interfere with face-to-face collaboration since the personal devices were design for personal usages. To improve the collaboration that takes place in small face-to-face groups in repeated episodes, we seek to strengthen relationships by encouraging non-verbal contact, which is known to be a key component to increasing intimacy in personal relationships. Through gathering the small group learning interactions in a collaborative learning scenario, this study proposed that classroom environments require, in addition to personal devices, special design of boundary objects to sustain and support social learning activities. An experimental classroom was developed with LCD displays and shared- display groupware. Analysis of student learning activity found that students working with only personal devices tended to learn together in a disjoint interaction pattern. Contrarily, in the environment with shared-displays as boundary objects students demonstrated a joint and coherent interaction pattern since they took more notice of the shared group work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:16Z (GMT).

In co-located groups of three, children performed exploratory activities, using tangible artefacts, to find out about light. Analysis suggests that the environment can support various collaborative activities, but of central interest, demonstrated the role of peer interference in learning activities. Verbal negotiation and synchronization of actions emerged as conflict-resolution strategies and an implicit agreement by the children for sharing the physical and virtual resources of the system was noticed. The physicality and `present at hand' nature of the input devices contributed to balanced levels of participation, particularly through action. Overall, the interference-prone tabletop environment contributed to creating a highly collaborative environment in which individual exploration was discouraged, leading the group through a productive process of collective exploration and knowledge construction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:16Z (GMT).

Our research, in contrast, focuses on describing the interactional small-group practices that take place in learning contexts. This paper considers these practices and how they work together to form the foundation for effective collaborative learning activities. It analyzes collaborative learning activities in a paradigmatic CSCL setting to discuss such small-group practices as: resolving cognitive conflict, pursuing inquiry, maintaining a group problem space and coordinating multiple modes of reasoning. These have broad implications for foundational issues of temporality, indexicality and group cognition.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:16Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In the single-touch condition, the tabletop surface allowed only one child to interact with the digital content at a time. In the multiple-touch condition, the children could interact with the digital content simultaneously. Results showed that touch condition did not affect the frequency or equity of interactions, but did influence the nature of children's discussion. In the multiple-touch condition, children talked more about the task; in the single- touch condition, they talked more about turn taking.

We take the perspective of identifying the characteristics of interactional moves as students interact and negotiate meaning in the computer-mediated collaborative learning (CSCL) environment called GroupScribbles (GS). Much work in group cognition and in interactional analysis of small groups looks at problem-solving in subjects like mathematics and science. In language learning, the task posed for collaborative activities does not focus on problem- solving, but it may be targeted towards enriching students' vocabulary and proficiency in language expression, developing their thoughts and writing through cogitating with new words, vocabulary and sentence construction. We hope the work can illuminate how students can co-construct knowledge mediated by GS representations for Chinese language learning. In the paper, we look at collaborative situations in which the group members are not seated together in the classroom, and so they have to collaborate through the GS medium.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:17Z (GMT).

Unfortunately, dominance behavior often naturally emerges in these situations, when one child monopolizes the mouse and keyboard. One way to mitigate this phenomenon is by providing each child with a mouse and a corresponding on- screen cursor so that everyone can interact. Though such multiple-mouse configurations reduce the possibility of total domination by one individual, they do not automatically eliminate dominance behavior completely. We propose the use of a design for small-group learning on shared computers based on enforced turn-taking in a split-screen, multiple-mouse environment. In an evaluation with 104 rural schoolchildren in India, we found that dominance behavior was indeed reduced through these design choices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:17Z (GMT).

Significantly, a ""face-to-face portable-device-mediated interaction module"" was proposed. The preliminary research findings indicate that adopting the WiCFG could improve the learning outcome of lower-achievement learners. Using the WiCFG had positive enhancements of learning motivation and engagement. In the group observation, using the WiCFG improved learners more interdependent in group collaborative learning and was generally well-received by the English teacher and the students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:18Z (GMT).

To study the impact of O-UI design on collaboration, a highly-dynamic ""complex"" O-UI was contrasted against more simplistic, ""remote-control"" O- UI design, in the context of a cancer-treatment simulation. As expected, when groups used the ""complex"" O-UI, there was less visitor-visitor interaction, but unexpectedly, their conversations were of higher quality. They also engaged in better task division and displayed better task performance. The increased attention ""simple"" O-UI users were able to devote to monitoring one another's actions seemed to encourage emergent competitive behaviors, which disproportionately affected the engagement of female visitors. ""Complex"" groups showed no gender-related differences in engagement.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:18Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The first study followed five student-groups longitudinally to examine evolution of academic knowledge practices. The findings from the second year data-collection show that trialogical practices were considered challenging, but often generated optimal-flow experiences. The second study investigated interprofessional work during a clinical course.

In parallel, to meet requirements of the U.S. Department of Education, we conducted classroom experiments to investigate the achievement differences between students who were randomized to use either TechPALS or a non-CSCL product. In this paper, we examine the design changes from initial classroom pilot tests to eventual attainment of statistically significant results, emphasizing the integration of technology, activity designs, and broader educational practices that was required to achieve impacts in ordinary, low-income schools.

In order to unpack gamers' commitment, the present study investigates collaboration in a Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG). It investigates gamers' practices in order to expose their everyday gaming activities and knowledge domains. Drawing on detailed descriptions of team gaming practices, the paper highlights that gamers' of MMORPGs are hands-on experts in handling a game interface. Their expertise is about skilled stances tied to gaming structures. Also, gamers are members in certain communities and adhere to both community specific epistemologies and to generic ones. These gaming stances are from certain educational approaches difficult to make-sense of, while gamers' commitments in other perspectives become means for learning. Lastly, in relation to MMORPGs and education, a neglected issue concerns social pressure in gaming communities, resulting in various forms of participation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:19Z (GMT).

The findings highlight the overall process and the differences in the students' levels of engagement and performance, indicating some special features of the programming environment that contribute to or cause difficulty in the creation of an effective learning environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:20Z (GMT).

Students visit these forums seeking help on specific queries from coursework and receive help from anonymous others. In contrast to help forums designed and supervised by educational researchers, these forums have a grassroots origin. This paper investigates one such calculus help forum for evidence that forum tutors are scaffolding students to contribute to the successful solution of the exercise they posted. An analysis of 200 exchanges on limit and related rates revealed the presence of effective guided problem solving (marked by leading questions and hints), albeit to a limited extent.

To study a prototype of such a situation of computer-supported information exchange, we arranged a shared database setting as a basis of an empirical research program. This knowledge-exchange situation represented a social dilemma: while contributing information to a shared database led to costs and provided no immediate benefit to the individual, the entire group suffered when all members decided to withhold information. A series of experiments identified a multitude of influencing factors in this situation: group size, awareness of the importance of information, costs of entering information, use-related bonus systems, feedback and recommendations, and group awareness. This paper describes the impact of these factors on people's willingness to share their knowledge with their cooperators, and concludes with a discussion of some practical consequences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:21Z (GMT).

Next, I discuss one research projects which I am currently pursuing that build on early work and suggest how educational programs might employ such practices to advantage. Finally, I discuss what I see as the educative value of this technology in certain contexts and suggest a course for future research and development.

This technology concedes users a more active role in creating Web content. This has important effects both on individual learning and collaborative knowledge building. In this paper we will present an integrative framework model to describe and explain learning and knowledge building with social software on the basis of systems theoretical and equilibration theoretical considerations. This model assumes that knowledge progress emerges from cognitive conflicts that result from incongruities between an individual's prior knowledge and the information which is contained in a shared digital artifact. This paper will provide empirical support for the model by applying it to Wikipedia articles and by examining knowledge-building processes using network analyses. Finally, this paper will present a review of a series of experimental studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The results show that learners who were active reflectors in their blogs, but who were also interested in what others achieved, obtained the best results in knowledge tests. Based on the analysis, two distinct learner profiles that reflect differences in the students' dependencies can be distinguished: monitor and reflector. Furthermore, an indirect dependencies found in the analysis suggests that both reflectors and monitors are also active wiki editors and participants in face-to-face discussions. Further qualitative analyses are needed in order to get an in-depth view of the complex interactions and dependencies within and between the face-to-face and virtual, but also individual and social, planes of collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:22Z (GMT).

Collaboration scripts are didactic scenarios that guide and support the collaborative learning activity while adaptive collaboration scripting is the idea that computer-supported collaboration scripts can be adapted during run time, to provide learning experiences tailored to individual and group characteristics. An adaptation pattern is described as a well-defined adaptation process that can be initiated by the system when specific conditions are identified during script implementation. In order to model the proposed method twelve postgraduate students were engaged in a pyramid-type collaboration script and the analysis of the learning experience provided the basis for identifying a number of possible adaptation patterns. The paper discusses also next steps for advancing the design and evaluation of adaptation patterns in systems for scripted collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:22Z (GMT).

This form of interaction and learning in small online groups of students presents novel challenges, both for the participating students and for researchers studying their work. Chats differ from talk-in-interaction since the composition, posting and visual inspection of text and graphical objects by any given actor is not observable by the other participants. These structural constraints on the organization of interaction require that actors deploy alternative procedures for achieving what turn taking achieves in talk-in-interaction. This paper describes how communication is organized in text chat, where postings have to provide instructions on how they are to be read. This organization is contrasted with turn taking in face-to-face communication.

To achieve optimal collaborative learning it is important to have a well designed script (preparation phase). It is also very important to being able to regulate learners' activities, because some activities can not be predicted in complex pedagogical scenarios as collaborative learning (regulation phase). WikiPlus helps enhancing the collaboration process by enabling the teacher to adapt the script whenever non predicted learner's activities happen. A prototype has been implemented, the impact of different regulation mechanisms on collaboration is discussed and wishes for macro script authoring tools of the future are formulated.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:23Z (GMT).

Two groups of students studied learning material using a web environment designed for supporting case-based learning. The first group followed a non-scaffolded individual mode of study while students in the second group were guided by a collaboration script to work (in dyads) on the case material. Statistical analysis indicated no significant differences in the learning outcomes of the two groups. Qualitative analysis (based on students' interviews and field observations) revealed that students' self-organization resulted to a broad range of actual script implementation ranging from full conformance to partial violation of the script guidelines. The paper discusses the socio-cognitive role of students' self-organization during scripted collaboration and presents suggestions for the teacher and CSCL designer in order to enhance the engagement of collaborating students to productive learning interactions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:23Z (GMT).

This is because synchronicity does not easily allow students to take into consideration collaborative scripts in the heat of discussions. Also, moderation by teachers of synchronous discussions has been considered as extremely challenging so far. We describe here a study in which we trained students-teachers to moderate synchronous discussions and asked them to moderate discussions in two different ways of guidance, social and argumentation guidance. We show that moderation of synchronous discussions is feasible as effects of moderation on argumentative, social and interactive aspects of the discussion reflect the kind of guidance suggested. Also we show differences between girls and boys in the way they participate in synchronous discussions and respond to the moderator's suggestions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:23Z (GMT).

Thus, embedding assessment in Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) scripts can potentially enhance the enactment of collaborative learning sessions, by explicitly indicating how assessment is to be carried out. However, assessment design has also been recognized as a demanding task for non-expert instructional designers or practitioners. To tackle this problem, the use of learning and assessment patterns has already been reported as a way of supporting script design for non-experts. In this context, the combination of patterns of different nature (learning-oriented and assessment-oriented) can be regarded as an essential task of CSCL script design. This paper discusses how to support this task, focusing on the joint application of patterns, and describes an evaluation of the proposed approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:24Z (GMT).

A computer-supported environment offers several possibilities to handle the specific demands of this target group, for example, by structuring the learning situation with Floor Control. Floor Control explicitly structures the activities in the learning environment and implicitly enhances communication. To examine whether the Floor Control supports the collaboration process on activity level as well as on communication level or not, two versions of a CSCL environment were realized and compared with each other. The results revealed an improved task-related communication and a higher quality of learning results.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:24Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Appropriate collaborative cognitive activities may be evoked by structuring the whole learning task into phases and providing congruent external representations for each stage (i.e., representational scripting). It was hypothesized that this combination would lead to increased individual learning and better results for the collaborative task. In groups, 47 secondary education students worked on a complex business-economics problem in four experimental conditions, namely one where groups received task-congruent representations for all stages and three where they received one of the representations for all three phases (task-incongruent). The results indicate that groups that received task-congruent representations in a phased order scored higher on the collaborative task, though this did not result in increased individual learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:25Z (GMT).

An experimental study was conducted to evaluate this hypothesis. The study design consisted of three independent groups of dyads from similar or different cultures (American-American, American-Chinese, and Chinese-Chinese) doing collaborative problem- solving in a knowledge-mapping learning environment. Participants interacted through an asynchronous computer interface providing multiple tools for interaction (diagrammatic workspace, embedded notes, threaded discussion). Based on empirical findings documenting cross-cultural variations in communication and cognition, several research hypotheses were advanced. Statistical results show that members of different cultures appropriated the resources of the interface differently in their interaction, and formed differential relations with and impressions of each other. However, analyses of the individually written essays show no statistically significant differences in learning outcomes. Implications for CSCL are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:25Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

While much existing adaptive assistance has focused on providing explicit feedback directly to the relevant student, we propose a two- dimensional design space which explores alternative methods of adaptive assistance that are implicit, indirect, or both. We investigated the viability of these ideas using data collected in a classroom evaluation of an ACLS system for peer tutoring which incorporated the design ideas in a manner that provided cognitive support to peer tutors. In this paper, we discuss how students interacted with the different forms of feedback, and propose a second iteration of the assistance that involves collaborative support in addition to domain support.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:26Z (GMT).

Therefore, negotiation has become a central issue of CSCL research. In an experimental field study with 16 groups of 3 individuals each, we examined whether the demand to use technically supported communication (e-negotiation) within an asynchronous and spatially distributed setting has a positive influence on group discussions and knowledge integration. Our results indicate that the implementation of e-negotiation is in fact advantageous, but does not automatically lead to a successful result. Employed intensively, e- negotiation allows group members to emphasize incompatible ideas and therefore offers advantages especially in creative problem-solving processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:26Z (GMT).

We also report the exploratory development of shared argument diagramming tools that allow learners to draw their explanations while they discuss them. The tools passively reinforce the IBE argumentation scheme. Evaluation of the tools provided the clearest evidence to date that learners are able to integrate their shared online argument diagramming with their computer-mediated dialogue.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:26Z (GMT).

Participants collaborated with a same- side peer in arguing against successive pairs of peers on the opposing side of an issue; in addition they engaged in some reflective activities. Another 18 sixth graders served in a control condition. Although transfer occurred in both directions, science condition participants exhibited transfer of skills to the social topic to a greater extent than did social condition participants to the science topic.

When designing learning activities under this scope, in a social context, the need for building supporting tools for the participants of such activities has been highlighted. We have implemented such tools, by applying Interaction Analysis (IA) techniques, in order to support the participants of asynchronous discussion learning activities. In this paper we study the effects of IA indicators on students' selfregulation. We present research findings from several implemented case studies, in order to confirm our hypothesis, that such supporting tools indeed facilitate students' selfregulation, as it was shown both quantitatively and qualitatively, thus enhancing the overall activity, as well as the collaborative process itself.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:28Z (GMT).

The notion of person-object relations (PORs) is introduced as the basic building block underlying both group awareness and social navigation. Four design principles of SCAN tools (response formatting, juxtaposition, aggregation/transformation, and prediction/recommendation) are discussed, and their application in CSCL scenarios is described. Finally, issues for both practical implications and use-inspired basic research on SCAN mechanisms will be explored.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:28Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The underlying assumption was that group functioning can be positively influenced by making group members aware of how their behavior is perceived by themselves, their peers, and the group as a whole. This awareness, which is conditional for behavioral change, is achieved through a peer assessment tool and a reflection tool. A 2x2 factorial between- subjects design was used. Participants were 39 fourth-year high school students who worked in groups of 3 or 4 on a collaborative writing task. Results show that groups with peer assessment tool developed better teams, had lower levels of group conflicts, and had a more positive attitude towards collaborative problem solving, than groups without a peer assessment tool. Thus, peer feedback on social behavior of group members can enhance group functioning in CSCL-groups.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:29Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In collaborative activities, students need to know and regulate their individual and collective time being aware about their own and their team-mates expected availabilities. Aiming to understand and enhance time awareness in distance learning context we introduced a methodology for the assessment of Group Time Awareness, based on the comparison of subjective and inter-subjective students' learning time perceptions. Assuming that enhancing awareness will help the collaborative learning process (McCarthy and Garavan, 2008) we hypothesize that group awareness could be improved by enhancing the reflexive properties of the Computer Learning Environment. For this purpose, we conducted an experimental study introducing a context-awareness tool in order to evaluate its impact on group time awareness scores.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:30Z (GMT).

Therefore, to be able to provide effective moderation, teachers should be given adequate awareness support. We evaluated our e-moderation system called ""Moderator's Interface"" comparing moderation with and without awareness support. Following a within subject design, our cases were two teachers who were asked to moderate discussions of their students and to choose and prepare a discussion topic compliant with the curriculum. Results indicate that additional awareness support was deliberately used during moderation when available. An analysis of data from the teachers' answers to 120 questions and tasks indicates that in the awareness condition, both teachers performed better on the tasks as compared to moderating without awareness support. However, it could not be corroborated that teachers gained additional knowledge about the discussion solely from using the awareness support in absence of an external task.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:30Z (GMT).

The recursive, bottom-up writing process requires the pupils to collaboratively carry out ""word/phrase pooling"", ""sentence making"", ""paragraph writing"" and ""outlining"" on wiki, and eventually composing their essays individually. The intention is to fill up the gap between the current-traditional product-oriented approach and the more cognitively demanding process- oriented approach, that is, juvenile L2 learners' limited linguistic and cognitive skills that would hinder them from writing proper essays, not to mention carrying out process writing. The results of our pilot study show that the target pupils' micro-skills for writing were improved significantly due to emergent peer coaching. There is also an implication that through such peer coaching activities, the perceived challenge of pupils' individual differences in linguistic proficiency could be turned into an advantage for motivating pupils' collaboration in learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:31Z (GMT).

Without neglecting this viewpoint we give reasons for an alternative framework. We call this alternative a ""trialogical"" approach; it emphasizes joint and organized work with artefacts and practices as a basis for collaborative learning. The paper explains the use of this notion and clarifies theoretical backgrounds for the approach in line with the knowledge creation metaphor of learning, and relates it especially to knowledge building and socio-cultural and cultural- historical theories of human cognition. Various theories concerning mediation are briefly analyzed. The paper also explains how dialogues and trialogues are close to each other if, for example, the role of common ground is analyzed further. Lastly, design principles of the trialogical approach are concisely described.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The groups differed in terms of the number of members and the amount of scaffolding aimed at group processes and task requirements. The models, produced using the HeuristicsMiner algorithm, showed that the group with fewer members that received more instruction in the task requirements had a more linear decision-making process than the group that received instruction in group processes, however neither were an example of a linear, unitary phase model. This approach has relevance both for CSCL research methods and for providing feedback to students on their decision-making processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:06:32Z (GMT).

We describe a project (ARISE: Augmented Reality in School Environments) that aims to realise this potential by developing a collaborative, robust and affordable Augmented Reality learning platform for schools. The learning affordances of Augmented Reality are discussed, and an educational application is described that supports remote collaboration between students in a shared 3D workspace, where students from different countries present, discuss and manipulate virtual objects relating to their local culture. The evaluation of the application is based on a distributed summer school project involving students from two European countries. In addition to more conventional evaluation approaches, special requirements for evaluating remote collaboration in a shared Augmented Reality workspace have been met with a customised approach involving synchronised video observations in both locations with subsequent editing of the material into and a single screen giving a comprehensive overview of the collaboration from both ends. The results of the evaluation study are currently being analysed, but preliminary findings suggest that the Augmented Reality learning platform has been well received by students and teachers, and is well suited for remote collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:08Z (GMT).

To uncover these design principles, a meta-analysis was conducted of two dissertational studies that applied the Perspectivity Framework and the video analysis tool, OrionTM. The first was a qualitatively-informed quantitative study; the second applied balanced mixed methodology--also referred to as quisitive research. The 7 design principles found include: stakeholder involvement; elastic coding; collections as selections and vice versa; applied authenticity; unfolding interpretations; layered critique; and revision tracking.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:10Z (GMT).

The purpose of the study was to investigate how the technology under investigation Knowledge Practices Environment (KPE) facilitates working collaboratively with shared knowledge objects. It appears that students used KPE mostly for managing and sharing project documentation; and that task was usually delegated to one team member. Students found that organizing items in the content view helped them to get an overview of the tasks, knowledge objects and their interrelationships. On the other hand, the flexibility of the KPE, especially the possibility for all team members to edit and change anything openly might also be a challenge; it requires systematic organization of materials. More research is needed before KPE's potentials and pitfalls in shared knowledge advancement can be reliably assessed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:11Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We use the phrase `Repertoires of Collaborative Practice' to describe the individual, interpersonal, contextual and community practices that can influence collaboration. We hypothesize that repertoires of collaborative practice are developmental in nature, and that collaborators may become adept at selecting which elements from their repertoires should be implemented in specific situations. The theoretical description is accompanied by four papers applying this framework to examine the collaborative practices in different collaborative settings online gamers, adolescent musicians, middleschool technology projects, and a comparative study of Quakers and product designers.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:17Z (GMT).

Our method traces contingent relationships between events at two granularities. We begin with an event in which the group is applying shared practices for the class of mathematical problems under consideration. In this event, participants construed certain inscriptions as representational resources for resolving the question at hand. We then search backwards to find chronologically prior episodes in which these and related inscriptions are constructed, resulting in a sequence of episodes through which the representational practices were developed. We then work forwards within each episode to construct an account of how the inscriptions become representations through the negotiated practices of participants, using methods similar to conversation analysis but attending to inscriptional acts as well as conversations in the chat tool. The resulting account shows not only how practices are negotiated locally, but also how prior work is re-invoked with the aid of persistent inscriptions. Intersubjective meaning-making takes place in interaction, but not in a vacuum: it draws on the history and resources of the group.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:17Z (GMT).

At the center of this issue lies an assistance dilemma: when to provide support structures and when to withhold them (at least temporarily) to optimize student learning. On the one hand, providing support structures right from the start has the advantage of reducing cognitive load, avoiding floundering and potential frustration. It may well lead to productive success, but there is also the danger of unproductive success--an illusion of performance without learning. On the other hand, withholding support may well lead to productive failure as students persist in active sense-making and problem-solving activities, but there is the danger of unproductive failure in students being overwhelmed. This symposium aims to interrogate issues pertinent to the assistance dilemma continuum by bringing together an eclectic group of CSCL researchers with commitments on various points on the continuum.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:18Z (GMT).

Qualitative methods allow complexity and interaction, but tend not to include representations or otherwise allow the reader to ""see"" the interaction as the researcher can. By combining traditional qualitative methods with statistical modeling, we are afforded a better opportunity to see aspects of a phenomenon, but not always greater integration; interpretation does not easily emerge from potentially divergent data sets. By including social network analysis, which provides both summary statistics and graphical depiction of interaction we are afforded a better opportunity to examine collaborative work. Furthermore, technology facilitates collection and analysis of change over time in computer supported collaborative work. These methods enable a multifarious view of quantitative data, and allow for interpretation to more naturally emerge from multiple data sets.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:18Z (GMT).

This meaning- making is seldom an individual activity; rather it involves interactional practices between clinical staff, and between the physician and the specific representational technology. This poster presentation contributes to earlier studies on professional vision and disciplined perception in that it emphasizes the role of feedback, power relations, and ontogeny that shape collaborative interpretation of what is seen on the screen. Taking an analytical perspective founded in ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, this study will closely examine participants of a medical training in PET reading to be held in a Finnish university hospital in spring 2009. Video-recorded data will be analyzed using discourse analytical methods with a focus in understanding the appropriation of professional concepts and analytical skills in relation to feedback, ontogeny, and power.

From community narratives to role-playing games to mathematical simulations to consciousness-raising presentations, the potential for creative production with Scratch is boundless. However, for those who are primarily concerned with assisting others' Scratch learning, there is a disconnect between what individuals want to do and the resources that are presently available. In response, we have developed Scratch-Ed, an online environment for educators. Using the lens of situated learning, Scratch-Ed has been designed to enable users to organize a community of practice for Scratch around the processes of mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire by sharing stories, exchanging resources, facilitating discussions, and establishing relationships.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:21Z (GMT).

Such lists have an important role in the professional communication of French teachers and exist for all secondary disciplinary fields. The increase of users for ten years indicates that this exchange medium can be an instrument for professional development. But, many discussion lists are managed by the ministry of education, and one can wonder if such lists are open spaces for all kinds of sharing or kinds of institutional disciplinary showcase. We studied all the messages, during three consecutive years, of a specific discussion list for management secondary teacher (named IGC 2752 messages) and an extract of a private list for librarian teachers (named CDIDOC 935 messages) and adopted an ad hoc coding process (with a triple dimension) to get an in-depth view of the nature of exchanges and an understanding of list regulation. The goal of the research is to get evidence of a list as a collaboration tool but results obtained give a contrasted picture of such teacher discussion list, more normative than democratic.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-09T16:07:22Z (GMT).
