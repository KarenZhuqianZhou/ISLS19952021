As a design tool, RoomCast supports accommodation to local curricular adaptations and technology platform availability, enabling the configuration of curated learning and teaching resource collections over a broad range of classroom contexts. In the classroom, RoomCast offers rapid redistribution of resources during teacher-initiated activity transitions, automatically distributing tailored sets of resources needed for the activity to heterogeneous client portals. While informed by research in technology supports for orchestration, RoomCast is not intended as a scripting tool for complex activity sequences. Rather, it is designed to support coarse-grained activity structures involving diverse types of stakeholders, placing responsibility for detailed activity management in the hands of teachers or custom scripts, in pursuit of a descriptive framework accessible to practitioners.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:20Z (GMT).

The goal of this systematic review is to identify gaps in methodological effort of quantifying human interactions and communication in terms of research contexts, levels of analysis, and time points of assessment.

Using a quasi-experiment design, we collected: (a) students' online Knowledge Building be- haviors, (b) group reading discussions, and (c) students' reading comprehension assessment. Our findings reveal that the experimental group (Knowledge Building) outperformed the con- trol group (direct instruction) on the comprehension assessment. Additionally, we found that the Knowledge Building intervention supported the development of students' higher-level read- ing comprehension.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:23Z (GMT).

Emergent leadership can improve group functioning, but this depends on how leadership is supported by group members. We studied how roles emerged in two groups of eighth-graders participating in CSCL activities over a 12-week science unit. A leader emerged in each group, but through different processes. Group A showed greater distribution of contributions to decision-making and science talk than Group B, as well as greater conceptual gains on a content test. In contrast, Group B focused more on off-task talk than Group A. While our sample is too small to make causal claims, better distribution of contributions to talk and on-task participation seemed to positively impact collaboration and learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:23Z (GMT).

However, it's still unclear how specific features of play orient students towards scientific modeling and thus science learning. We investigate how the organization of an activity where students pretend to be bees to learn about how bees pollinate might direct their attention either to treating these activities as play or to exploring the underlying rules about how bees behave in the real world in a manner more akin to modeling. We describe three activities where students appear to have engaged in different kinds of play and explore how their actions and teachers' orientation produced either playful rules or scientific accounts. The implications of this work will support teachers and researchers in organizing embodied play activities that help students engage with scientific concepts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:23Z (GMT).

Cohesion Network Analysis (CNA) can be employed by instructors to analyze discourse structure in terms of cohesive links in order to model student participation and interactions in collaborative learning environments. This paper presents an extended longitudinal analysis together with corresponding visualizations of participation generated for an online math course, powered by CNA. Multiple interactive views centered on the evolution of participation and of interactions between students clustered into three layers are generated using the CNA indices provided by the ReaderBench framework. Two types of sociograms are used to show the interactions between learners in the two course weeks that exhibited extreme conditions, namely: a) week 6, when a dramatic decrease of participation was identified, and b) week 16, when the highest number of participants and contributions were logged. In addition to the views centered on participants, we introduce a heatmap depicting the evolution of keyword relevance over time, as well as a Chord diagram for visualizing concept maps based on semantic relatedness. Our analytics dashboard can be used by tutors to monitor students throughout the term and to better ascertain the correlation of course material, schedule, and deadlines with the participation of students, as well as their interactions among themselves and with the tutor.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:24Z (GMT).

To do so, an online peer feedback system was designed and developed. They were then asked to write and argumentative essay (individually), to engage in argumentative peer feedback with their learning partner (collaboratively), and finally to revise their essays based on feedback which received (individually). The findings indicate that the online peer feedback supported by argumentative scripts outperformed other two conditions in terms of argumentative essay writing, argumentative feedback quality and students' learning.

Yet, how to guide uses of peers' ideas, and what the impacts of those ideas are on students' learning, are open questions. We implemented a web-based cell biology unit with 116 grade 7 students, and explored how peers' ideas are used during explanation building, and how prompts to draw on peers to either diversify or reinforce existing ideas impacted the quality of students' written explanations. Among other findings, exchanging ideas with peers led to all students improving their explanation quality upon revision; and students prompted to diversify their ideas showed greater learning gains by the end of the unit, while students prompted to reinforce ideas, who used more peer-generated ideas in preparation to write their explanations, produced higher quality explanations. This study builds our understanding of the influence of peer ideas on learning, and offers insight into supporting students in engaging effectively with peers' ideas.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:24Z (GMT).

The WISE units and professional development activities were developed using the Knowledge Integration (KI) Framework. We show that the KI framework functioned as an effective scaffold to support teachers in modifying their teaching practice to make curriculum customizations that are evidence-based and aligned with a theory of learning. We discuss how our study results informed the design of an online curriculum customization and implementation interface and offer the principles of the KI framework as design principles for the development of other collaborative professional development endeavors.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:25Z (GMT).

To help us investigate this question, we built a tabletop prototype that facilitates collaborative science learning from data visualizations and used this prototype as a testbed in a laboratory study with 11 family groups. We present an analysis of the types of gestural interactions that accompanied embodied cognition (as revealed by users' language) while learners interacted with our prototype. Our preliminary findings indicate a positive role of cooperative (multi- user) gestures in supporting scientific discussion and collaborative meaning-making during embodied cognition. Our next steps are to continue our analysis to identify additional touchscreen interaction design guidelines for learning technologies, so that designers can capitalize on the affordances of embodied cognition in these contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:25Z (GMT).

Benefits were viewed as complementary or supplementary to face-to-face program components and context. Parent access to information about their children not available to them during program participation may deepen understanding and strengthen feelings of connectedness, particularly important to parent-teacher relationships. While there was synergy on most platform benefits, teachers did not observe parents' value in maintaining the program climate of trust and safety, and extending feelings of community. These may be essential for the platform to represent the learning supports aligned with the offline program experience. Study findings lead to hypotheses on the role of an online environment in parents' mental models of programs for collaborative learning, and in social presence that strengthen collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:26Z (GMT).

In this study we evaluate the balance between type of guidance and learner characteristics while collaborative learning with agent-based models takes place. Participants were students from health-care programs and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: one group learned with agent-based models using the vicarious approach, where pairs viewed and discussed recordings of others using agent-based models; the other group explored agent-based models while discussing in pairs a set of text-based prompts. The results reveal that the vicarious-learning approach was superior to agent-based models' exploration. More detailed evaluation shows that nursing students' performance wasn't affected by the type of guidance, while less experienced in the content, non-nursing students, benefited more from vicarious guidance. Findings suggest that dialoguing while observing the dialogue of others can maximize immediate learning gains.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This study investigated the potential differences in students' learning outcomes from participating in a 13-week design-based unit. We used the pre- and post-test data from 361 eighth grade students (102 groups) and performed a hierarchical linear model analysis to examine how the convergence or divergence in the students' level of prior knowledge affected students' learning outcomes. We found that students in homogenous groups with similar levels of initial prior knowledge scored significantly higher on their post-test when their pre-test was used as a covariate, than students in heterogeneous groups.

We conducted a qualitative study on emoji's roles in peer feedback in a small group collaborative design activity; the activity was conducted entirely online as part of a distance education class. Using content analysis on the feedback peers provided, and thematic analysis on transcribed interviews, we analyzed how emoji are used and perceived in four types of design feedback. Our analysis suggests that emoji increase peers' awareness of affective status, and are also used to mark minor cognitive feedback with a more personal flavor as part of document-based conversations. We found that emoji help to establish a general informality for peer feedback activities. We discuss the implications for the design of collaborative learning software that supports richer peer feedback.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:27Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It directly impacts both the design process and the final design output. It is important for learners to develop the skill of managing uncertainties effectively. However, there is a lack of research investigating how students manage uncertainties during a collaborative design process and how effective uncertainty management skills may be developed in the learners. In this paper, we present the results of a pilot study investigating how middle school students collaboratively manage uncertainties while solving an engineering design challenge. We also discuss issues related to the management strategies used and reflect on how these issues can be addressed using a computer-supported collaborative learning environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:27Z (GMT).

The purpose of this study was to explore how two different studio art classes used a VDS environment to engage in studio practices and online critique processes. Through data analytics and thematic analysis, this study investigated how students collaborate during the critique process in a VDS environment. The results are supported in three ways: (1) VDS technology afforded viewing and the critique of artifacts, (2) the VDS failed to support dynamic peer collaboration, and (3) students sought technology alternatives to engage in deeper discussion. These findings aim to increase the effectiveness of VDS and expand the methods of online student collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:28Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Participants reported significantly higher teaching self-efficacy after the training. The VR participatory simulation better promoted the post-session, lab- teaching knowledge test performance than the live simulation. `Bicentric' perspective taking embedded in VR-based interactions facilitated both experiential and vicarious learning.

However, in a collaborative learning session, students engage in a range of behaviors and it can be difficult to indicate which of those behaviors correlate with higher outcomes. In this paper, we propose using Extreme Value Theory (EVT), a method that considers the data points in the tail (upper or lower) of the distribution, to analyse the relationship between collaborative process variables and outcome measures through insights derived from high impact, low-frequency events. Specifically, in this paper, we analyse the relationship between dual gaze patterns and outcome measures across two different datasets. In both datasets we found that students with lower outcomes had lower focus during the collaborative session. This paper provides a contribution by both introducing EVT as a viable method for analysing CSCL data as well as demonstrating the effectiveness of eye- tracking as a collaborative indicator to use to adapt to in real-time.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:29Z (GMT).

Such skills refer to the students' use of language as a tool to enable understanding of each other's knowledge, which creates the possibility of constructing new knowledge together. Digital technology in classroom activities can support this form of dialogue, but it must be embedded into a classroom's complex ecosystem to be beneficial. This paper explores how a group of seventh grade students were taught dialogic skills through the integration of microblogging in the classroom. The data analysed consists of video from the classroom, and the study is grounded in sociocultural theory. Findings suggest that integrating microblogging in classroom activities increased participation and made students' contributions more visible, thus creating the opportunity for students to build on each other's knowledge. However, this is dependent on the teachers' facilitation of the activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:29Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Teachers thus organise their thinking, workflow and classroom interactions using textbooks. However, text media limit students' ability to imagine the dynamics embedded in mathematics and science formalisms, such as vectors. We outline an affordable design that augments textbooks, to: allow all students to imagine such dynamics; help teachers reorganize their thinking and workflow; make all classrooms highly collaborative. The design consists of a 'touchy-feely vector' system (smartphone-based manipulation of vectors), a 'virtual lesson plan' (manipulable simulations that extend textbook figures), and a 'mixed-media' textbook (QR codes pasted next to figures, linked to manipulable simulations). We discuss how this integrated design changed learning and teaching practices, based on an ethnographic study of experimental and control classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:29Z (GMT).

However, learners often fail to pay attention to their own or their peers' emotions during learning (Eastabrook, Flynn &amp; Hollenstein, 2014). As the experience of some emotions (e.g., anxiety, shame, and fear) may be maladaptive to learning, it is important to raise learners' awareness of their emotions and their peers' emotions and support them in reacting timely and wisely in response to such emotions. To this end, we conducted an authentic study to identify learners' practices and preferences regarding their awareness of the types of academic emotions they experience and the extent to which they share such emotions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:30Z (GMT).

To understand the unique perceptions of newer and experienced teachers when delivering PD through an online platform, we conducted post-experience interviews, coded the transcripts, and analyzed the connections between the codes using epistemic network analysis. Findings revealed significant differences in how teachers perceive PD delivery format; experienced teachers had positive perceptions of face-to-face PD while newer teachers had positive perceptions of online PD. In terms of the online discussion, there were no significant differences; both groups articulated positive perceptions. Implications for evolving the design of online PD approaches are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:30Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Learners collaboratively or individually generated a diagram that represented energy flow (constructive scaffold) or observed a peer learner generating the diagram (example-based scaffold). We hypothesized that collaborative learners would benefit more from the constructive than the example-based scaffold, but that the opposite would be the case for individual learners. Seventy-one university students were randomly allocated to conditions in the 2X2 between-subjects design. Climate change understanding was measured at pre- and posttest. Preliminary results supported our hypothesis. We conclude that the constructive scaffold elicited questions that led to deep engagement in the collaborative condition, resulting in better understanding. Individual learners possibly failed to recognize crucial concepts in the constructive condition because they had questions but nobody to discuss with. They profited more from the example-based scaffold which emphasized central concepts of climate change.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:31Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

While previous work has identified the ecological factors that impact OSB, research has not yet distilled the specific learning processes behind such collaborations. From a case study analysis of three families, this work explores the funds of knowledge that children and parents rely on as they engage in collaborative learning experiences through OSB. We demonstrate how in-home computer supported collaborative processes are often informal, collaborative, social, and highly relevant to solving real-life information challenges. Our work shows how parents and children draw on their funds of knowledge when they search collaboratively, with and for their family members, to build their collective knowledge of technology and problem-solving.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:31Z (GMT).

It is also the case that the nature of student engagement when they use representations in their learning is rarely examined. We report preliminary findings of a systematic review on the nature of student engagement when using multiple representations. Our analysis resulted in 4 categories of student engagement revealing various levels of learner agency.

Two 5th grade learners were recorded as they worked together to program and navigate a robot across a 3'x3' grid of obstacles. The video was then analyzed using a grounded theory approach (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) to determine how cognition manifested in an embodied manner (e.g., gesturing, use of conceptual metaphor) through the tools and affordances employed by the learners. Four primary tools were used by learners in solving their robotics task: (1) basic robot moves, (2) gestures, (3) the map and the computer, and (4), the grid and the robot. These tools provided symbolic access to direct experiences, supporting an emergent and reactive process in which perception and action were intimately linked. Implications for computer science and improving the design of computer-supported collaborative learning are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

AEP employs evidence-based teaching practices (e.g., formative assessment, universal design for learning) to address college students' diverse learning needs (i.e., their strengths, interests, and areas for growth). AEP provides collaborative computer- supported project-based opportunities that enable students to extend the application of course concepts to embedded contexts that engage them as learners. To compare AEP and active- learning control conditions, this study utilizes identical measures: validated surveys, interviews, observation notes, anonymous course-feedback forms, and formative and summative assessments. Multivariate regression analyses suggest that students learning through AEP outperformed control conditions by a full letter grade and scored on average 14.20 percentage- points higher on final assessments, when controlling for disability status, gender, and pre-test achievement. AEP has a large standardized effect size on the final (d=2.40) and provides a framework to improve student success through embedded and extended learning opportunities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:32Z (GMT).

The availability of valid instruments and norms for CPS achievement would also promote CSCL adoption within the wider education arena. This study explores two methods of assessing CPS: using the ATC21S online tasks and using qualitative discourse analysis of the same groups of students' transactions as they work together on an authentic learning task. By comparing the measurements arising from both methods, we raise issues and contradictions observed and suggest further research directions related to the measurement of CPS.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:32Z (GMT).

Despite the significant interest in making-&amp;- tinkering activities, most of the research has focused on implementations in non-formal and informal educational settings, with learners of older age (i.e., students in secondary school). The present study sought to investigate young students' knowledge gains, attitudes towards a making-&amp;-tinkering approach to learning mathematics in formal education and the development of 21st-century skills as they engaged in a collaborative making-&amp;-tinkering project using a variety of arts, crafts, and technological tools such as a physical robot. The making-&amp;-tinkering approach involved making, tinkering, programming, and play in a group project integrated into the formal mathematics curriculum. Findings from the study suggest that young students can greatly benefit from such an approach. The study has demonstrated the applicability and value of such methods for young learners in formal educational contexts, with implications for future research and practice in the field.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:33Z (GMT).

A pedagogical model named the Spiral Model of Collaborative Knowledge Improvement (SMCKI) is proposed in this study to inform the system and learning activity design. Starting with a stage of individual brainstorming, the pedagogical model scaffolds students to go through five stages of intra-group and inter-group knowledge improvement and refinement, to support the advancement of their collective and individual knowledge. The results showed that the students significantly improved on their scientific content knowledge through the staged collaboration argumentation activities in the web based learning environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:34Z (GMT).

Participants were 38 college students enrolled in an ""Introduc- tion to Living Technology"" course at a Taiwanese university. They were randomly assigned to eight groups. Each group discussed their design ideas in a computer-supported collaborative knowledge-building environment - called Knowledge Forum (KF) - to collaboratively design a product. Data includes students' design discussion in KF and analysis focused on online knowledge-building activities and groups' design-thinking modes. In general, knowledge- building activities cultivated students in design-thinking modes during the design process as a group. Specifically, the extent to which groups sustained online engagement and the advance- ment of their group knowledge had a major impact on their design performance. Ways of ap- plying knowledge-building principles to foster effective design processes are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Data collection included questionnaires evaluating students' baseline, knowledge gains, perceptions of technology integration, and post-activity interviews. Findings showed higher learning gains and more positive perceptions of technology integration, in terms of opportunities for student negotiation, for the students in the low-embodied condition.

We propose three dimensions: reliability, learnability and critical-construction, as a framework for investigating collaborative learning within naturally occurring social media. We use YouTube as a focal case. Our review of literature on YouTube as a space for informal peer learning suggests that post- video deliberative comments hold much promise as precursors for co-construction of knowledge. However, questions remain concerning the veracity of user-contributed videos, and the adequacy of this medium for different learning goals. Nonetheless, investigating the educative value of non-formal person-to-person knowledge sharing on social media can be an important direction for CSCL research in its aim to support learners in formal environments for future life-long learning and civic engagement.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:37Z (GMT).

However, tools not specifically designed for CSCL may lack supports for collaboration and disciplinary reasoning. Therefore, it is necessary to design supports into classroom orchestration. In this paper we examine the design of such orchestration to scaffold historical reasoning with geospatial data visualizations. The orchestration of a sequence of small-group tasks scaffolded progressively more complex reasoning about historical waves of immigration, which the instructor leveraged to support students' reasoning at multiple levels in whole-class discussion. Our analyses point to these kinds of orchestrated scaffolds as a valuable direction for CSCL research and design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We designed the Idea Thread Mapper (ITM) system to support knowledge building in each classroom community as well as idea interaction across communities. At a local classroom level, students engage in focused inquiry and knowledge- building discourse. As their inquiry proceeds, they carry out metacognitive conversations to frame/reframe their collective inquiry directions and processes and synthesize their journey of thinking over time. For cross-community interaction, they selectively share productive idea threads and syntheses in a cross-community space for idea contact with broader knowledge builders. Supported by ITM, we conducted design-based research in a network of Grades 3-6 classrooms. Findings and implications are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:39Z (GMT).

One aspect of context is the notion of disciplines such as science, math, and the language arts (Sawyer, 2006). To date, however, research that explores the relationship between knowledge and disciplinary context has typically focused within a single disciplinary frame, such as science (e.g., Banks et al., 2007). This paper aims to explore the influence of disciplinary boundaries between science and language arts on students' developing practices. We present data from a mixed-age first and second grade classroom where students collaboratively engaged with a book about honeybees from either a science or a language arts frame. Analyses of students' individual written critiques reveal how they consistently adapted their criteria for what makes a good representation based upon the disciplinary framing.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:40Z (GMT).

A classroom evaluation of our system showed it was effective at detecting collaboration breakdowns and provided preliminary evidence that just-in-time adaptive support for collaboration might help to deter disruptive behavior in small group settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:40Z (GMT).

While a growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness of such an approach, there is great variation in defining the specific strategies and approaches, making it difficult to advance the field. We examined 19 college instructors for over 220 hours using AL methods. We coded the observed classroom activities according to teacher- and student-centered behaviours. On average, these teachers allocated over 50% of class time to group work. A cluster analysis revealed four distinct patterns of student-centred activity: (1) frequent, short duration; (2) longer duration; (3) less frequent, short duration; and, (4) mixed. Two approaches to workflow were identified: 1) tightly orchestrated and 2) front-loaded with less structured periods of work. Results suggest typologies of instructional patterns, growth trajectories and new directions for examining AL.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:41Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Youth sailing involves intensely immersive embodied experiences in boats, but also reflection on broader principles and processes. Coordinating between these two levels is often difficult for youth, particularly over a short time frame in an interest-driven environment. We present two existing tools that we believe have the potential to bridge this difficult conceptual and motivational gap, but involve very different epistemological hurdles. Using both existing footage of the tools in action and interactive reworking, we hope to collaborate with other participants to further specify the affordances and constraints of these tools, and potentially more effectively hybridize them toward our curricular goals.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:41Z (GMT).

The Geniventure game was developed to support student learning of core concepts in genetics via challenges that engage students with genetic phenomena at the molecular level. A core feature of the game is that it simulates behavior of molecular entities (genes, proteins, organelles) with high disciplinary fidelity to how these mechanisms really operate in the cell. In this sense, it is deeply disciplinary. The commitment to disciplinary fidelity presents design challenges regarding the ways in which entities, activities, and mechanisms are represented and manipulated in the game across the biological organization levels. We discuss five distinct types of design challenges that we identified based on data from focus groups with students who played the game and provide design heuristics for addressing these challenges.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:41Z (GMT).

Students, on the other hand, have shown a lack of interest towards team projects, are not always satisfied with their teamwork, and experience challenges in the process of collaborative work (Espey, 2010).

Science inquiry also tends to involve faraway locales, distant from students' extensive everyday knowledge of surrounding spaces and places (Barton &amp; Tan, 2009). In this paper, we share findings from the most recent iteration of a larger design-based research project that directly engaged elementary students in modeling a local complex ecological system, the soil ecology underfoot in the schoolyard. We examine how 5th grade students used interactive GIS maps in whole class discussions, moving between their everyday experiences in the schoolyard, the data collection experience, and the classes' aggregated data in reasoning about complex socio-ecological relationships and explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:43Z (GMT).

Our approach to addressing this question is multimodal, involving two sources of data: (a) a record of students' online conversations, and (b) the frequency and duration with which documents were open on each student's screen. This study suggests that in this specific case, relatively thin data about reading frequency and mean reading duration can be used to make inferences about students' reading behavior in a CSCL context where it is impossible to observe directly. It also shows the power of a multimodal approach to the data--here, we are using one mode of data (discussion) to get a better understanding of another mode (clickstream).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:46Z (GMT).

However, developing and using these approaches in ways that maintain a commitment to theory and situational context is a significant challenge. This paper proposes integrative visualization, a computationally assisted, human-centered process to visually explore data collected in collaborative learning contexts in a way that maintains a commitment to theory and situational context. To do so, this paper summarizes how integrative visualization supported the development and use of interaction geography, an approach to describing, representing, and interpreting collaborative interaction across the physical environment. This paper concludes by emphasizing the need to further develop integrative visualization in the CSCL and LS communities through stronger connections with the information visualization community.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:48Z (GMT).

We also examine whether parent learning partner roles are associated with children's opportunity to experiment with digital production activities. Based on earlier ethnographic studies we predicted that there would be variability of the number of roles played across our sample, and that parents active in the technology industry would play more roles, especially those potentially catalyzed by some level of expertise or knowledge, such as teaching, modeling practice, collaborating on technical projects, or lending resources. Our findings were consistent with these hypotheses. For both mothers and fathers, the level of technology use at work was associated with the diversity of learning partner roles. Counts of the diversity and density of parent roles was significantly associated with the breadth of children's experience with digital production activities.

Sixth- grade students working in pairs (N = 78) were randomly assigned to either a choice or no- choice condition for investigating the insulation effectiveness of different materials. The choice students were asked to select one of two equivalent scenarios to investigate with the experimentation model. In contrast, the no-choice students were randomly assigned a scenario to investigate. Our findings indicate that the choice students more often used the model to test their prior ideas than their no-choice peers. Furthermore, the choice students also ran more informative experimentation test patterns that yielded valid and useful data for understanding heat energy transfer with the model. The findings from this study provide promising insights into the potentially beneficial impact of incorporating choice into science learners' experiences in the classroom.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:49Z (GMT).

However, these social processes and their influence on teachers' learning (i.e., adopting new practices) are notoriously hard to study, given their implicit and informal nature. In this paper, we apply the Knowledge Appropriation Model (KAM) to trace how different social processes relate with the implementation of pedagogical innovations in the classroom (as a marker of professional learning), through the analysis of more than 20,000 artifacts from Go-Lab, an online community to support inquiry-based learning. Our results not only show how different social processes like sharing or co-creation seem to be related to increased classroom implementation. Also, they provide insights on how we can use traces from digital co-creation platforms, to better understand the social dimension of professional learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:49Z (GMT).

Traditional research on group formation has investigated mostly separate learner characteristics as preconditions of learning. Combinations of different learner characteristics and of learner characteristics with collaborative processes have been less in focus. Considering such combinations is necessary to represent the complexity of group interactions and learning. Despite the digitalization of learning, there has been only few attempts to investigate the diagnostic information that mining learner texts and learning processes can contribute to addressing this complexity for optimal group formation, and to assign groups automatically based on multiple parameters simultaneously. This symposium brings together a multi-disciplinary and international consortium of researchers who all focus on group formation for computer supported collaborative learning. They complement each other in investigating different combinations of learner characteristics, learning processes and automatic techniques for optimal group formation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:49Z (GMT).

However, a teacher's presence hinders student collaboration in some cultural contexts, and some students may not have a teacher or knowledgeable adult who can provide this support. We conducted an experiment with K-1 students (N=36) in a rural Tanzanian village, where we trained students to provide technology support for their peers under different experimental conditions. We found that with basic technical training and social awareness of the assigned leaders, students can indeed provide peer support in the absence of a teacher, and additionally enable collaboration. We challenge the popularly held notion that natural leaders will emerge and support students' technology and learning needs without adequate training, and discuss the implications of our findings in the deployment of technologies in similar socio-cultural contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:50Z (GMT).

Microblogs like Twitter have the potential for engaging citizens in civic discourse about such issues but also pose challenges due to partisan behaviors and length limitations. Given the saliency of social media in young people's lives, we examined in an exploratory study whether integrating a 140-character limit within an audience response system supported high school students' argumentation about socioscientific issues during a synthetic biology workshop. After analyzing students' anonymous online responses, worksheets, and observations, we found that students generated diverse evaluative claims as well as used argument-based rationales and weighed counter arguments when assessing their peers' claims. In our discussion, we address the affordances and constraints of microblogging in supporting students' argumentation of socioscientific issues about synthetic biology.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:50Z (GMT).

In the first layer of the analysis, we conducted an SSNA to numerically represent collective knowledge advancement and to compare group performances between different levels of learning outcomes. In the second layer, we carried out an Epistemic Network Analysis to examine the relationship between students' shared epistemic agency and learning outcomes. The results revealed that high learning-outcome groups were engaged in epistemic actions to generate new ideas; this led them to quick and sustainable knowledge advancement.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:51Z (GMT).

Studies and assessments were developed to conceptualize and to measure CPS skills. Most studies operationalized different dimensions of CPS skills as discrete measures even though they may be interweaving in the construct. In this study we went beyond the separate measures on the different dimensions and focused on the connections among these skills. Using log data of 20,947 events on actions and chats from 43 teams, we studied how different dimensions of CPS skills were connected as reflected in problem solving. CPS skill networks were constructed to capture the co-occurrence of the skills in turns during collaboration. The results showed that teams with high and low performance had significantly different CPS network structures.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:51Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This study analyzes the extent to which a computer science curriculum based on digital storytelling helped students become more effective at debugging. Prior research has developed digital storytelling as a medium for computational participation, but few studies have reported detailed results on growth in computer science skills. Meanwhile, research on debugging has tended not to address sociocultural factors. This study, conducted over four months of a middle-school computer science course using interactive storytelling, analyzed student reading, writing, and debugging practices based on approximately 1000 story edits and user behavior collected from the platform's logs. The results suggest that literacy-based computer science education using digital storytelling can be productive for developing skills such as debugging.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:52Z (GMT).

A key component to developing the community for collaboration was the use of online global meet-ups, or facilitated video conference sessions where participants from different sites share projects and feedback. Meet-ups were key to establishing social trust and motivating project collaboration across sites. This paper examines participant discourse at different stages of the community formation process. Data from three online meetings with U.S. and Kenyan students were analyzed using epistemic network analysis (ENA). Findings show significant changes in the patterns of discourse corresponding to the development of the community over time. The initial emphasis on self-awareness and superficial information sharing shifted toward peer teaching and knowledge acquisition after six months. These observations demonstrate how the depth of interactions within online global meet-up culture evolved into more substantive interactions towards collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:54Z (GMT).

Applying flow patterns on large-scale contexts present challenges to educators in terms of orchestration load. Orchestration technology can support educators to manage collaborative activities; yet existing technology do not address flexibility challenges like accommodating growing numbers of students or tolerating dynamic conditions in learning settings. We define elasticity and dynamism as two key elements in the flexibility of a script. Elasticity is related to the capacity of an orchestration technology to incorporate varying participant counts. Dynamism is the capacity to maintain a pedagogically meaningful script progression in presence of different individual behaviors. In this paper we propose flow creation and flow control mechanisms to address elasticity and dynamism in orchestration technology for Pyramid flows. These mechanisms, implemented in the PyramidApp tool, have been evaluated across four scenarios varying from small to large settings. The results show that rules enabling pyramid creation on-demand and the use of timers are useful to achieve elasticity and dynamism in the pyramid formation and progression in an automatic manner.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:54Z (GMT).

However, research showed that many wikis are not necessarily suited to make relevant content salient and thus users need further guidance. In an experimental laboratory study on wikis, we investigated two guidance types in conjunction with the Need for Cognitive Closure: (1) visual markers to highlight controversy status (implicit guidance) and (2) a collaboration script that directs users towards discussions (explicit guidance). We analysed the quality of N = 724 wiki contributions, namely final edits to an article and corresponding discussion replies. The results show that both guidance types do neither directly affect the user contributions to the wiki nor the learning outcome. In interaction with the individual Need for Cognitive Closure there was a meaningful effect on the quality of discussion contributions, matching previous research findings on the quantitative learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:54Z (GMT).

The model consists of three levels: 1) introduction (teacher introducing topic for learning), 2) reconstruction (building in Minecraft and creating a script for role-play), and 3) transformation (acting out role-play and producing a video).

In our dual eye-tracking design study we developed an embodied activity that potentially contributes to technologically extended problem solving in trigonometry. We tested three versions of the design: (a) individual sensorimotor enactment only, (b) individual and then collaborative enactments, and (c) individual enactment and then collaborative description followed by enactment. As our first case showed, the required sensorimotor coordination was developed but never used in the following problem solving when a student worked alone. In contrast, in both collaborative cases the relevant sensorimotor coordination became a part of instrumented action scheme. Future research is needed to investigate if intercorporeal coordination with the other is crucial for the transfer of sensorimotor coordination from their original source to instrumental activity in mathematics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:56Z (GMT).

However, little research shows how such technology influences dynamic family interactions in the home over time. An in-the-wild study was conducted in six family homes over three weeks. An Alexa, with a number of skills, was set up in each home for the families to use. The findings showed differences in use over time. To begin, family cohesion behavior and family rituals were most prevalent. At the end of the study, the skills were found to motivate distinct family interaction patterns: including more collaboration to manage Alexa and scaffolding of children's interactions with Alexa, given developmental differences in users' grasp of Alexa's capabilities and limitations. We discuss how voice assistants support different interaction patterns and potentially, offer different learning opportunities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:57Z (GMT).

In this paper, I leverage prior work on joint visual attention (Tomasello, 1995) and analyze the eye-tracking data collected during the study. This paper provides three contributions: 1) I use an emerging methodology to capture joint visual attention in a co-located setting using mobile eye-trackers (Schneider &amp; al., 2018); 2) I then replicate findings showing that levels of joint visual attention are positively correlated with collaboration quality; 3) finally, I present a new measure that captures cycles of collaborative / individual work, which is positively associated with learning gains (but not with collaboration quality).

In this project, we designed a Hololens-based system in which participants learned about the physics involved in audio speakers (Radu &amp; Schneider, 2019). We analyzed participant dyad where educational AR representations were present or not, focusing on the relationships between collaboration, learning, leadership, and knowledge imbalance. We find that, overall, AR representations improved time management, learning of structural concepts but reduced learning of physical concepts. The effects of leadership were mediated by the presence of AR: the presence of leaders in AR was linked to higher learning gains and better collaboration, whereas these effects were not present without AR. Finally, for groups with imbalanced knowledge, AR seemed to benefit participants in configurations where less- knowledgeable participants took the lead in discussions. These results indicate that AR can be beneficial for equalizing the effects of imbalanced collaboration. We discuss the implications of those results for the design of CSCL learning activities using augmented reality.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:55:59Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

As a part of this model, classroom teachers were partnered with coaches with whom they worked on content-focused coaching cycles. Within a coaching cycle, teachers and coaches met to plan a mathematics lesson, the teacher video recorded the lesson, the coach and teacher both annotated the lesson video, and finally the two met to debrief the lesson verbally. We report on the process of video annotations. Data analysis focused on identifying the type of response within an annotation as well as the extent to which the teacher or coach noticed students' mathematical thinking. We contend that the annotation process afforded opportunities for direct suggestions to teachers that may not have otherwise occurred. Findings indicate annotations were predominantly focused on mathematics content goals and classroom discourse practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:00Z (GMT).

Through interaction analysis of video data, we identified ten data wrangling practices and developed a conceptual model of the data wrangling process that contains four interrelated recursive stages. These data wrangling practices and the process of data wrangling are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positioned the youth as having agency and authority over big data.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:01Z (GMT).

In this model, dialogic feedback is conceptualized as a collaborative learning activity with three interconnected phases, involving different levels of regulated learning. Grounded in this model, Synergy comprises tools to support learning activities during dialogic feedback. These tools incorporate scripting and learning analytics support to guide learners. By using Synergy as an example, we discuss the importance of informing the design of CSCL tools with theories.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Through online-delivered challenges teachers and students work together to complete a series of tasks that help teachers learn about communicating across cultures and preparing several communication-aids to help them reach out more frequently. Through a narrative profile analysis, we uncovered the types of influences the five-week intervention can have on teacher's home communication efforts, beliefs in their own ability to develop stronger language skills, and relationships with students, and we trace the implications these efforts have on teacher practice, design iterations, and scaling.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:02Z (GMT).

A central problem in modeling collaboration in this way is thus determining, for any contribution to a discussion, the appropriate context for modeling the connections being made--that is, for determining the appropriate recent temporal context. Recent temporal context is typically defined using a moving window of fixed length. However, that length is dependent on the setting, and there are no existing methods for reliably determining an appropriate window length. This paper presents an empirical method for measuring recent temporal context, and thus for defining an appropriate window length to be used in analyses of complex, collaborative thinking. Importantly, the method we describe minimizes the need for human annotation while providing both qualitative and quantitative warrants for choosing a particular window length.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:03Z (GMT).

To be successful, the learning must be enacted (in classrooms), but the community is ephemeral. To investigate whether participants on one large online teacher professional development (OTPD) site were hampered in forming community, or overcame these barriers, this study interviewed members of the PD site to get at their sense of community. Using grounded theory, the transcripts of the interviews were coded to reveal members' perceptions of community in this online space. Results suggest that most consider themselves as part of the community, and, importantly, see this as a space in which to share material resources.

Syntheses of CSCL research can help to answer questions about the prevalent topics and outcomes in the field. There are a number of synthesis methods to choose depending on the methods used in the primary studies as well as goals of the synthesis. Meta-synthesis is also available to better integrate findings obtained using different research methods. This symposium showcases a spectrum of different synthesis methods used in CSCL.

Our results suggest that in this context cotemporal models constructed with Epistemic Network Analysis outperform sequential models constructed with Sequential Pattern Mining in terms of (a) explanatory power, (b) efficiency, and (c) interpretability.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:04Z (GMT).

A 9-week augmented virtual learning environment (AVLE) course, Virtual City Planning, was created and implemented in a science museum classroom. In-game and in-class student data and mentor observations were collected and analyzed using Quantitative Ethnography (QE) techniques to identify patterns of identity exploration enacted over time. This paper offers group findings to illustrate general trends of identity exploration during the AVLE, and one illustrative case study to provide an in-depth look at an integrated identity exploration trajectory. This work concludes with a discussion of the need for promoting identity exploration as an educational goal, and a means to support learners to adapt to the changing workforce of tomorrow. The affordances of AVLEs are discussed to advance research in this nascent area.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:04Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Despite the powerful potential for cross-fostering of ideas between these fields, one key question arising inquires whether educational scientists--who focus on the interventionist, design-based study of learning--and social scientists, who concentrate on analytic study of spontaneous social interaction and knowledge construction, can engage in a productive collaboration. This symposium seeks to address this question by adopting an interdisciplinary lens, through which these perspectives have been integrated, or at least juxtaposed, to develop new insights regarding what it means to learn in an information-based networked society. Six interdisciplinary research projects that represent lessons learned from synergistic projects among researchers from these fields are presented in this symposium.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:07Z (GMT).

This study traces the evolution of KB and KF practices in relation to changes in teacher efficacy and positive student outcomes. Over the span of a school year, teachers co-designed principle-based practices with their students to foster collective discourse, idea improvement, community norms, and meta-cognition/meta-talk in their classrooms.

However, while place-based curricula are localized, they are also authentic, problem-based experiences, which have been shown to be effective in their own right. Without controlling for the impact of authenticity, it is not clear whether localization itself improves student learning. In this study, we used a place- based simulation to engage students with authentic problem-based learning about a specific place: a city that is local for some students and not for others. We assessed differences in cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes between these two groups. Our results suggest that learning outcomes are better when students engage in a place-based simulation about their own locality, indicating that place does play a critical role in the success of place-based education.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:08Z (GMT).

Specifically, prompting others to do their share of the work, might be challenging for interpersonal relationships. Thus, addressing the social psychological dynamics in online learning environments, an online experiment was conducted (N = 352). In a 2x(2x)2 between-subjects design the nature of the sender (group member/system), the senders past proficiency (high/low) and publicness (private/public message) were varied to explore whether automated mediation can reduce detrimental effects and enhance impartial message perception, sender impression and causal attribution. Contrasts by sender and proficiency demonstrate improved message perception, sender impression and internal causal attribution when prompts were sent by the system instead of average or low proficient fellow students. Among all groups, public nudges indicate more negative, but also more persuasive perception, however system public and private nudges did not differ.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:08Z (GMT).

We identified various patterns that make clearer the micro-judgments monitoring routines entail for teachers' (a) ways of moving among students and conversational initiation, (b) conversational entry; (c) focus of the interaction; (d) when and how to exit the interaction; and (e) conversation participation pattern; with an eye toward teachers' goals and instructional contexts.

We find that collaboration, meaning-making and problem solving is also occurring even when collaborators are lacking words for expressing their thoughts in talk. Thus, we promote the idea of viewing CSCL as a field concerned with intercorporeality in meaning-making practices. Through a detailed analysis of a group of architectural engineering students, we unpack how they prepare for a critique session by building upon each other's utterances, gestures and manipulations of objects in their design studio thus displaying intercorporeal memory and understanding. Based on the analysis we discuss three themes related to incorporeality in CSCL: Ecologies of technologies, Historical development of the bodily-material resources and Subtle manifestations of intercorporeal understandings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:09Z (GMT).

One popular configuration is where dyads collaborate by sharing a single computer sitting side-by-side. However, prior research points to potential challenges for elementary students when sharing a single computer when collaborating. This prompted us to explore another configuration where dyads sit side by side but collaborate on a shared virtual platform with individual computers. We compared the discourse of students' collaboration under these two settings. Results show that although there are no significant differences in the amount of collaborative talk between the two configurations, there is qualitative evidence of how differing affordances of two configurations shape collaborative elementary students' practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:11Z (GMT).

We investigate how these processes are interactionally accomplished in and across intertextually tied events where devised, generated, accessed, curated and appropriated digital texts are connected in webs of meaning. The concepts of multimodality and intertextuality from literacy studies provide explanatory theories to investigate how digital texts in the developing dialogic space are consequential the learning process across the phases of a PBL cycle.

Drawing on web-log data and video-ethnographic data, we argue that four characteristics of FUSE support equity: the design of the challenges; the diverse ways of knowing and doing supported by the activity system; the specific interactions encouraged by the activity system; and the program's placement inside school. We focus, here, on gender equity, but also discuss implications and planned research on other aspects of equity.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:13Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It is the process by which researchers identify salient properties about segments of CSCL data: what they are, what they contain, or what they mean. Coding, like all processes in research, is subject to error. To reduce the potential impact of coding error, CSCL researchers typically measure inter-rater reliability (IRR). However, there is no extant method to determine what level of IRR would invalidate a CSCL result or model. One way of assessing the potential impact of such inaccuracies is by conducting sensitivity analyses, which measure the level of error that would need to be present in the data to invalidate a given inference. This paper introduces a new method for conducting sensitivity analyses in CSCL: the Binary Replicate Test.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:14Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Traditional MOOCs are not designed for collaboration and social interaction among participants that build communities, which has been shown to be an important aspect of effective PD. This study provides insights in designing for collaboration on a traditional MOOC platform (in our case edX). A pilot study was run with a small group of in-service teachers to test a collaborative design with an eye to how the design will scale to a full MOOC. Objectives and theoretical framework There is a growing need among teachers for greater access to effective, on-demand, low-cost professional development (PD) (Fishman et al., 2013). Traditional face-to-face PD is expensive, and limited in relevance, applicability, and ability to scale (Hill, 2015). Online PD is a rapidly growing option that can make it more broadly accessible. PD offered online can be as successful as face-to-face (Fishman et al., 2013). Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide the opportunity to explore the viability of such online approaches at larger scales. However, there are drawbacks to MOOC participation that pose barriers to implementing effective PD. collaboration among participants and social interaction that build communities are two conditions that encourage engagement but are not well-supported technologically in MOOCs (Kop, 2011). We seek to design a MOOC that overcomes these barriers to collaboration and community building. In order to do this research, a pilot study was run with a small group of teachers in order to explore how successfully a MOOC platform and framework can be used to encourage collaboration with the aim of eventually scaling to larger participation. We build on research that positions teachers as knowers and agents of change (Cochran-Smith &amp; Lytle, 1999). This posits that teachers are active participants in building their own knowledge rather than passive recipients (Fenstermacher, 1994). Through a cross-case study Booth (2012) found that social learning was able to build knowledge sharing and trust among teachers. Other studies have demonstrated that collaboration can increase knowledge creation and sharing in an online space (e.g., Duncan-Howell, 2010). In order to encourage collaboration in our SPOC, we built on existing best practices for encouraging collaboration in online PD (e.g. Booth, 2012; Hew &amp; Cheung, 2014). These findings were used directly in the development of the collaborative learning portion of the course and the prompts that led teachers into that space. Methods This paper is part of a long-standing program of research funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation which undertakes the design and dissemination of a curriculum to teach common topics in high school biology through complex systems simulations (Yoon et al., 2017). In adapting the PD for the complex systems curriculum to a wider audience, the PD was moved to an online platform: Edge, the pilot testing platform for edX. We used three design categories which emerged from the literature to promote collaboration throughout the course: 1) periodic required discussions in the online forum; 2) open-ended questions based on course content to prompt the sharing of reflections on practice; and 3) expectation of participant comments on others' reflections. The participants in the first implementation of the course were eight in-service teachers from six different schools in three urban districts in the Northeastern US. This paper is part of a larger study which collects data at both the teacher and student level over an entire year. A selection of the data from the summer PD was analyzed: teacher enrollment forms, teacher interviews, and teacher post-surveys were used as primary sources of data, while preliminary data from the discussion board posts was used to triangulate some of the findings. We combined the open-ended responses from the enrollment forms, satisfaction surveys, and interview transcripts which were all then inductively mined for themes. The themes were given positive and negative levels and a coding manual was created representing the themes and","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this study, we are looking at a subset of data from a larger study (N=120), in which participant pairs interacted with an augmented sound producing speaker. We explored the learning behaviors in eight pairs of learners (N=16) who participated in an unstructured physics activity under two conditions: with or without AR. Comparing behaviors between the two experimental conditions, we found that AR affected learning in four different ways: participants in the AR condition (1) learned more about visual concepts (ex: magnetic field structures) but learned less about nonvisual content (ex: relationship between electricity and physical movement); (2) stopped exploring the system faster than NonAR participants; (3) used less aids in exploration and teaching; and (4) spent less time in teaching their collaborators. We discuss implications of those results for designing collaborative learning activities with augmented reality.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Moreover, the nature of collaboration is shifting to a more sophisticated skillset that includes accomplishing tasks through mediated interactions with peers halfway across the world or even computer-generated agents. The 4 papers presented in this symposium focus on this new opportunity of introducing computer-generated agents in collaboration as well as the challenges entailed. The presentations will cover a broad range of topics ranging from the assessment of collaborative problem-solving skills to the use of computer-generated agents in intelligent tutoring systems. In addition, they will illustrate the validity and practicability of various state-of-the-art approaches to introduce non-human collaborators into human collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:16Z (GMT).

To address this gap, we draw from sociocultural theorizing, with a specific interest in the notions of funds of knowledge and knowledge creation. We ask: how do the students' funds of knowledge mediate their knowledge creation during STEM learning in a novel computer-supported makerspace? Our findings indicate three forms of knowledge creation during STEM learning: ""horizontal knowledge creation"", ""vertical knowledge creation"", and ""extended knowledge creation"". Our work joins with the line of research focused on complex intersection between students' funds of knowledge and schooled knowledge in a third space. It makes visible how a novel computer-supported makerspace makes available a repertoire of digital, material and social resources that can advance the emergence of creative third spaces.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:16Z (GMT).

However, these learners often encounter conflicts that may arise based on the learning task itself or on external factors. Little is known about the nature and evolution of conflicts that occur when elementary learners work together. To investigate this phenomenon, we analyzed videos of six pairs of students completing a programming activity. We identified four stages of conflict: initiation, escalation, de-escalation, and conclusion. Our analysis showed that the conflicts typically began around disagreements about code, who should have control of the keyboard and mouse, and other interpersonal events. Also, we found that some pairs of students resolved their conflicts through self-explanation and listening while others did not take advantage of those constructive strategies. This research reveals some ways in which conflicts evolve between elementary learners, and how we may be able to support them in conflict resolution while solving problems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:18Z (GMT).

To learn effectively, they need to regulate emerging learning challenges through the choice of fitting strategies. So far, little is known about what strategies fit which challenges. We present a theoretical account for the definition of fit between regulation challenges and strategies in collaborative learning, thereby differentiating between direct and indirect strategies, and test its validity in an empirical study. We asked 163 university students in 90 groups to rate the challenges they encountered in their self-organized group meetings, and to report strategies by aid of which they regulated their biggest challenge. Answers were coded into 26 strategy types. We found that students mostly used strategy types that directly address their biggest challenges. Multilevel-modelling indicated that direct strategies are associated with higher satisfaction for coordination- and comprehension-related challenges only, but not for motivational challenges.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:19Z (GMT).

We show how the participants used many source concepts in the exploration of the abstract concept of `thinking', and were able to build a conceptual synthetizing metaphor. Our results support a bimodal metaphors salience hypothesis: metaphorical gestures play a great role in making reasoning visible to others and therefore fostering collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:19Z (GMT).

In our learning environment, experts developed a scripted scenario as a sequence of potential actions, and we explore possibilities for enhancing interactions by enabling users to type free inputs that are matched to the pre-scripted statements using Natural Language Processing techniques. In this paper, we introduce a clustering mechanism that provides recommendations for fine-tuning the pre-scripted answers in order to better match user inputs.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:21Z (GMT).

This paper describes how families use technology and new media for multi-tasking in order to collaboratively accomplish many routine tasks around their homes. Families employ a number of approaches to media multi-tasking, and their sociotechnical practices reflect how children learn to multi-task, learn through multi-tasking, and learn despite multi-tasking. I draw on these practices to explain how families manage shared- and divergent -objects of activity at home, and how technology is implicated in this maintenance work. I offer a multi-dimensional framework for multi-tasking that suggests how determining what is consequential for learning with technology is often contingent on a number of tools, tasks, purposes, and people.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:21Z (GMT).

In this paper, we present a first step in the development of UbiCoS: five co-design sessions with 16 learners that give insight into learners' perceptions of help-giving.

To address the challenge of mapping characteristics of individuals' speech to information about the group, we coded behavioral and learning-related indicators of collaboration at the individual level. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of predicting the quality of collaboration among a group of students working together to solve a math problem from human-labelled collaboration indicators. We use a corpus of 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students working in groups of three to solve math problems collaboratively. Researchers labelled both the group-level collaboration quality during each problem and the student-level collaboration indicators. Results using random forests reveal that the individual indicators of collaboration aid in the prediction of group collaboration quality.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:26Z (GMT).

This symposium features four projects in which teachers and researchers engaged in technology-mediated collaboration to design inquiry-based learning environments to engage students in authentic disciplinary practices in a variety of content areas, including literary reading, literacy in mathematics, science, and engineering design. The size and scope of the collaborations vary, ranging from one-to-one to larger groups, as does the time span of the collaborations, providing opportunities to examine temporal affordances of technology supports. All four papers discuss collaborative co-design as sites of professional learning for teachers.

Utilizing a qualitative multi-site case study design, the study found that a connected learning approach boosted the development of girls' CT skills, positively impacted attitudes towards computing pathways/careers, and increased understandings of computational participation. In addition, the educational experiences happening throughout the SciGirls Code program exemplifies the 4E learning model.

A key design involved students writing on KF inquiring into knowledge- building principles and meta-talk on the processes. Results indicated that the students engaged in productive online discourse on both domain and discourse understanding progressively. Classroom analyses suggested how students engaged in meta-talk and inquiry into principles with corresponding change in the knowledge about discourse.

This study aims to identify the major components of collaborative knowledge construction in an ER learning environment and to investigate the mediating role of ER as mindtools to support group metacognition. Data analysis involved a micro-level examination of students' discourse, interaction with the technology, peers and the facilitator, using fine-grained analysis of video and audio recordings. The results made evident that metacognition, along with questioning and answering, were prevalent elements of collaborative knowledge construction around ER. We support that ER can be used as a learning tool and can be effective in supporting group metacognition through immediate feedback, openly accessible programmability and students' embodied interaction with the physical robot. Beyond the instrumental role of ER for supporting metacognitive processes in CSCL settings, the study provides initial evidence for a temporal relation of metacognitive talk to collaborative talk in group problem-solving.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:30Z (GMT).

The discourse from a meet-up between students in Kenya and the U.S was coded with these global competences. Epistemic network analysis (ENA) is used to evaluate for meaningful connections between the codes. Upon analysis of the data, lifelong learning and trans-disciplinarity exhibit the strongest connection, which supports the fundamental goals of the project fostering critical thinking among students globally through media-making and discussion of STEM subjects. Furthermore, the two groups of students Kenyan and American demonstrated different strengths; the Kenyan students focused on self-agency and using diverse tools, while American students were content-driven. These complementary behaviors collectively exemplify the seven global competences and are an example of building skillsets for future workforce environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:31Z (GMT).

The practices for doing so are opaque, analog, expensive, inefficient, and entrenched. This makes schools resistant to embodied, enactive, extended, and embedded collaborative learning. Digital badges can contain (a) specific claims about such broad learning, (b) web-enabled digital evidence supporting those claims, and (c) information about how that evidence was obtained. Badges can then circulate this information readily in social networks where they can gain additional meaning. This paper explores how CSCL goals might be served by using badges to shift towards capturing, recognizing, endorsing, and motivating learning, and doing so for a much broader range of learning than otherwise possible.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:32Z (GMT).

Quantitative analysis confirmed the extent to which interactions in the annotation activity were expansively framed and found a significant correlation between expansive framing and open-ended exam performance. Qualitative analyses confirmed that expansively framed interactions made numerous connections between disciplinary course knowledge and nascent disciplinary teaching practices. More generally, the study showed that expansive framing can be easily and successfully used to support generative collaborative learning in online courses.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:32Z (GMT).

Two types of epistemic scaffolding are differentiated based on existing literature and educational practices, namely, implicit and explicit epistemic scaffolding. Implicit epistemic scaffolding refers to the support (including tool, activities, resources, etc.) that has epistemic implications but is not made obvious to learners. Explicit epistemic scaffolding refers to the support that intentionally makes epistemic ideas explicit to learners to promote their epistemic understanding. Many of the CSCL environments have been designed with epistemic underpinnings, which could serve as implicit epistemic scaffolds. We propose that embedding explicit epistemic scaffolds in CSCL environments that are designed with implicit epistemic scaffolds is a promising way to maximize the power of support for epistemic growth.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:33Z (GMT).

Drawing on sociocultural theorizing, Bakhtinian inspired notion of the ""dialogic space"", and material-discursive onto- epistemology, we introduce the concept of social object to explain how material objects can turn into joint attention and meaning-making in ongoing interaction. Video recordings (75 hours) of 94 students' aged 9 to 12 years old and their teachers' interactions in the makerspace were analyzed. The study shows how the material objects of the makerspace were enacted into social objects via joint attention about the objects, around the objects and with the objects. The study demonstrates the need to rethink the meaning and role of material objects in novel educational makerspaces for establishing and negotiating joint attention, mediating learning opportunities and tensions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T19:56:34Z (GMT).

Grounded in this model, Synergy comprises tools to support learning activities during dialogic feedback. These tools incorporate scripting and learning analytics support to guide learners. By using Synergy as an example, we discuss the importance of informing the design of CSCL tools with theories.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:13Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Youth sailing involves intensely immersive embodied experiences in boats, but also reflection on broader principles and processes. Coordinating between these two levels is often difficult for youth, particularly over a short time frame in an interest-driven environment. We present two existing tools that we believe have the potential to bridge this difficult conceptual and motivational gap, but involve very different epistemological hurdles. Using both existing footage of the tools in action and interactive reworking, we hope to collaborate with other participants to further specify the affordances and constraints of these tools, and potentially more effectively hybridize them toward our curricular goals.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:13Z (GMT).

This study analyzes the extent to which a computer science curriculum based on digital storytelling helped students become more effective at debugging. Prior research has developed digital storytelling as a medium for computational participation, but few studies have reported detailed results on growth in computer science skills. Meanwhile, research on debugging has tended not to address sociocultural factors. This study, conducted over four months of a middle-school computer science course using interactive storytelling, analyzed student reading, writing, and debugging practices based on approximately 1000 story edits and user behavior collected from the platform's logs. The results suggest that literacy-based computer science education using digital storytelling can be productive for developing skills such as debugging.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:15Z (GMT).

In this project, we designed a Hololens-based system in which participants learned about the physics involved in audio speakers (Radu &amp; Schneider, 2019). We analyzed participant dyad where educational AR representations were present or not, focusing on the relationships between collaboration, learning, leadership, and knowledge imbalance. We find that, overall, AR representations improved time management, learning of structural concepts but reduced learning of physical concepts. The effects of leadership were mediated by the presence of AR: the presence of leaders in AR was linked to higher learning gains and better collaboration, whereas these effects were not present without AR. Finally, for groups with imbalanced knowledge, AR seemed to benefit participants in configurations where less- knowledgeable participants took the lead in discussions. These results indicate that AR can be beneficial for equalizing the effects of imbalanced collaboration. We discuss the implications of those results for the design of CSCL learning activities using augmented reality.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A central problem in modeling collaboration in this way is thus determining, for any contribution to a discussion, the appropriate context for modeling the connections being made--that is, for determining the appropriate recent temporal context. Recent temporal context is typically defined using a moving window of fixed length. However, that length is dependent on the setting, and there are no existing methods for reliably determining an appropriate window length. This paper presents an empirical method for measuring recent temporal context, and thus for defining an appropriate window length to be used in analyses of complex, collaborative thinking. Importantly, the method we describe minimizes the need for human annotation while providing both qualitative and quantitative warrants for choosing a particular window length.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:16Z (GMT).

We designed the Idea Thread Mapper (ITM) system to support knowledge building in each classroom community as well as idea interaction across communities. At a local classroom level, students engage in focused inquiry and knowledge- building discourse. As their inquiry proceeds, they carry out metacognitive conversations to frame/reframe their collective inquiry directions and processes and synthesize their journey of thinking over time. For cross-community interaction, they selectively share productive idea threads and syntheses in a cross-community space for idea contact with broader knowledge builders. Supported by ITM, we conducted design-based research in a network of Grades 3-6 classrooms. Findings and implications are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:16Z (GMT).

However, while place-based curricula are localized, they are also authentic, problem-based experiences, which have been shown to be effective in their own right. Without controlling for the impact of authenticity, it is not clear whether localization itself improves student learning. In this study, we used a place- based simulation to engage students with authentic problem-based learning about a specific place: a city that is local for some students and not for others. We assessed differences in cognitive, affective, and behavioral outcomes between these two groups. Our results suggest that learning outcomes are better when students engage in a place-based simulation about their own locality, indicating that place does play a critical role in the success of place-based education.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:16Z (GMT).

Family members rely on each other's language and digital literacy skills in this collaborative information problem solving process known as online search and brokering (OSB). While previous work has identified the ecological factors that impact OSB, research has not yet distilled the specific learning processes behind such collaborations. From a case study analysis of three families, this work explores the funds of knowledge that children and parents rely on as they engage in collaborative learning experiences through OSB. We demonstrate how in-home computer supported collaborative processes are often informal, collaborative, social, and highly relevant to solving real-life information challenges. Our work shows how parents and children draw on their funds of knowledge when they search collaboratively, with and for their family members, to build their collective knowledge of technology and problem-solving.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:16Z (GMT).

Thus, we promote the idea of viewing CSCL as a field concerned with intercorporeality in meaning-making practices. Through a detailed analysis of a group of architectural engineering students, we unpack how they prepare for a critique session by building upon each other's utterances, gestures and manipulations of objects in their design studio thus displaying intercorporeal memory and understanding.

However, developing and using these approaches in ways that maintain a commitment to theory and situational context is a significant challenge. This paper proposes integrative visualization, a computationally assisted, human-centered process to visually explore data collected in collaborative learning contexts in a way that maintains a commitment to theory and situational context. To do so, this paper summarizes how integrative visualization supported the development and use of interaction geography, an approach to describing, representing, and interpreting collaborative interaction across the physical environment. This paper concludes by emphasizing the need to further develop integrative visualization in the CSCL and LS communities through stronger connections with the information visualization community.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:17Z (GMT).

This study aims to identify the major components of collaborative knowledge construction in an ER learning environment and to investigate the mediating role of ER as mindtools to support group metacognition. Data analysis involved a micro-level examination of students' discourse, interaction with the technology, peers and the facilitator, using fine-grained analysis of video and audio recordings. The results made evident that metacognition, along with questioning and answering, were prevalent elements of collaborative knowledge construction around ER. We support that ER can be used as a learning tool and can be effective in supporting group metacognition through immediate feedback, openly accessible programmability and students' embodied interaction with the physical robot. Beyond the instrumental role of ER for supporting metacognitive processes in CSCL settings, the study provides initial evidence for a temporal relation of metacognitive talk to collaborative talk in group problem-solving.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:17Z (GMT).

However, tools not specifically designed for CSCL may lack supports for collaboration and disciplinary reasoning. Therefore, it is necessary to design supports into classroom orchestration. In this paper we examine the design of such orchestration to scaffold historical reasoning with geospatial data visualizations. The orchestration of a sequence of small-group tasks scaffolded progressively more complex reasoning about historical waves of immigration, which the instructor leveraged to support students' reasoning at multiple levels in whole-class discussion. Our analyses point to these kinds of orchestrated scaffolds as a valuable direction for CSCL research and design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:18Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Through interaction analysis of video data, we identified ten data wrangling practices and developed a conceptual model of the data wrangling process that contains four interrelated recursive stages. These data wrangling practices and the process of data wrangling are important to understand for supporting future data science education opportunities that facilitate learning and discussion about scientific and socioeconomic issues. This study also sheds light on how the family migration modeling context positioned the youth as having agency and authority over big data.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:18Z (GMT).

In-game and in-class student data and mentor observations were collected and analyzed using Quantitative Ethnography (QE) techniques to identify patterns of identity exploration enacted over time. This paper offers group findings to illustrate general trends of identity exploration during the AVLE, and one illustrative case study to provide an in-depth look at an integrated identity exploration trajectory. This work concludes with a discussion of the need for promoting identity exploration as an educational goal, and a means to support learners to adapt to the changing workforce of tomorrow.

One popular configuration is where dyads collaborate by sharing a single computer sitting side-by-side. However, prior research points to potential challenges for elementary students when sharing a single computer when collaborating. This prompted us to explore another configuration where dyads sit side by side but collaborate on a shared virtual platform with individual computers. We compared the discourse of students' collaboration under these two settings. Results show that although there are no significant differences in the amount of collaborative talk between the two configurations, there is qualitative evidence of how differing affordances of two configurations shape collaborative elementary students' practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:18Z (GMT).

A pedagogical model named the Spiral Model of Collaborative Knowledge Improvement (SMCKI) is proposed in this study to inform the system and learning activity design. Starting with a stage of individual brainstorming, the pedagogical model scaffolds students to go through five stages of intra-group and inter-group knowledge improvement and refinement, to support the advancement of their collective and individual knowledge. The results showed that the students significantly improved on their scientific content knowledge through the staged collaboration argumentation activities in the web based learning environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:19Z (GMT).

Applying flow patterns on large-scale contexts present challenges to educators in terms of orchestration load. Orchestration technology can support educators to manage collaborative activities; yet existing technology do not address flexibility challenges like accommodating growing numbers of students or tolerating dynamic conditions in learning settings. We define elasticity and dynamism as two key elements in the flexibility of a script. Elasticity is related to the capacity of an orchestration technology to incorporate varying participant counts. Dynamism is the capacity to maintain a pedagogically meaningful script progression in presence of different individual behaviors. In this paper we propose flow creation and flow control mechanisms to address elasticity and dynamism in orchestration technology for Pyramid flows. These mechanisms, implemented in the PyramidApp tool, have been evaluated across four scenarios varying from small to large settings. The results show that rules enabling pyramid creation on-demand and the use of timers are useful to achieve elasticity and dynamism in the pyramid formation and progression in an automatic manner.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:19Z (GMT).

However, research showed that many wikis are not necessarily suited to make relevant content salient and thus users need further guidance. In an experimental laboratory study on wikis, we investigated two guidance types in conjunction with the Need for Cognitive Closure: (1) visual markers to highlight controversy status (implicit guidance) and (2) a collaboration script that directs users towards discussions (explicit guidance). We analysed the quality of N = 724 wiki contributions, namely final edits to an article and corresponding discussion replies. The results show that both guidance types do neither directly affect the user contributions to the wiki nor the learning outcome. In interaction with the individual Need for Cognitive Closure there was a meaningful effect on the quality of discussion contributions, matching previous research findings on the quantitative learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:19Z (GMT).

Specifically, prompting others to do their share of the work, might be challenging for interpersonal relationships. Thus, addressing the social psychological dynamics in online learning environments, an online experiment was conducted (N = 352). In a 2x(2x)2 between-subjects design the nature of the sender (group member/system), the senders past proficiency (high/low) and publicness (private/public message) were varied to explore whether automated mediation can reduce detrimental effects and enhance impartial message perception, sender impression and causal attribution. Contrasts by sender and proficiency demonstrate improved message perception, sender impression and internal causal attribution when prompts were sent by the system instead of average or low proficient fellow students. Among all groups, public nudges indicate more negative, but also more persuasive perception, however system public and private nudges did not differ.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:20Z (GMT).

AR can make information otherwise invisible visible in the physical world in real-time. In this study, we are looking at a subset of data from a larger study (N=120), in which participant pairs interacted with an augmented sound producing speaker. We explored the learning behaviors in eight pairs of learners (N=16) who participated in an unstructured physics activity under two conditions: with or without AR. Comparing behaviors between the two experimental conditions, we found that AR affected learning in four different ways: participants in the AR condition (1) learned more about visual concepts (ex: magnetic field structures) but learned less about nonvisual content (ex: relationship between electricity and physical movement); (2) stopped exploring the system faster than NonAR participants; (3) used less aids in exploration and teaching; and (4) spent less time in teaching their collaborators. We discuss implications of those results for designing collaborative learning activities with augmented reality.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:20Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We report on two three-week collaborative teaching experiences in a teacher education program in social studies where we experimented with different ways of intertwining block building and role-playing in Minecraft. We created a model for integrating collaborative learning and virtual worlds in social studies classrooms, referred to as collaborative knowledge adaptation. The model consists of three levels: 1) introduction (teacher introducing topic for learning), 2) reconstruction (building in Minecraft and creating a script for role-play), and 3) transformation (acting out role-play and producing a video). Data were collected through interviews, an open-ended questionnaire, and product (video) analysis. We focus our analysis on generic skills interwoven with domain-specific skills and three levels of intersubjectivity toward a shared knowledge object.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:20Z (GMT).

Additionally, I report on pre- and post-measures indicating participants learned targeted science concepts and hybrid embodiments supported learning one particularly unintuitive concept.

We conducted a qualitative study on emoji's roles in peer feedback in a small group collaborative design activity; the activity was conducted entirely online as part of a distance education class. Using content analysis on the feedback peers provided, and thematic analysis on transcribed interviews, we analyzed how emoji are used and perceived in four types of design feedback. Our analysis suggests that emoji increase peers' awareness of affective status, and are also used to mark minor cognitive feedback with a more personal flavor as part of document-based conversations. We found that emoji help to establish a general informality for peer feedback activities. We discuss the implications for the design of collaborative learning software that supports richer peer feedback.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:21Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, little is yet known about technology integration for embodied learning in groups in authentic classroom settings, as existing studies have been mostly conducted in laboratory settings. In this work, we examine students' learning and perceptions of technology integration for group learning in a high-embodied, Kinect-based educational game (Condition1, n=24 students), in comparison with a low-embodied, desktop- based version of the same game (Condition2, n=18 students), in an authentic classroom setting. Data collection included questionnaires evaluating students' baseline, knowledge gains, perceptions of technology integration, and post-activity interviews. Findings showed higher learning gains and more positive perceptions of technology integration, in terms of opportunities for student negotiation, for the students in the low-embodied condition. Implications are discussed for supporting high-embodied learning activities for group learning in authentic classroom settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:21Z (GMT).

To learn effectively, they need to regulate emerging learning challenges through the choice of fitting strategies. So far, little is known about what strategies fit which challenges. We present a theoretical account for the definition of fit between regulation challenges and strategies in collaborative learning, thereby differentiating between direct and indirect strategies, and test its validity in an empirical study. We asked 163 university students in 90 groups to rate the challenges they encountered in their self-organized group meetings, and to report strategies by aid of which they regulated their biggest challenge. Answers were coded into 26 strategy types. We found that students mostly used strategy types that directly address their biggest challenges. Multilevel-modelling indicated that direct strategies are associated with higher satisfaction for coordination- and comprehension-related challenges only, but not for motivational challenges.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:21Z (GMT).

Discussion and after-discussion reflection transcripts of 12 teams over five sessions were analyzed and assessed, using previously developed collaborative discourse rubric and sense- making coding construct.

It is the process by which researchers identify salient properties about segments of CSCL data: what they are, what they contain, or what they mean. Coding, like all processes in research, is subject to error. To reduce the potential impact of coding error, CSCL researchers typically measure inter-rater reliability (IRR). However, there is no extant method to determine what level of IRR would invalidate a CSCL result or model. One way of assessing the potential impact of such inaccuracies is by conducting sensitivity analyses, which measure the level of error that would need to be present in the data to invalidate a given inference. This paper introduces a new method for conducting sensitivity analyses in CSCL: the Binary Replicate Test.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

With the goal of better understanding the relationship between participation and the development of beliefs about oneself, we then connect our analyses with the students' self-reflections in interviews. For Eric, a novice programmer whose passion is art, the experience of being positioned routinely as a knowledgeable explorer supported him to feel capable of resolving problems and attaining goals that he set for himself, even as he encountered challenges and frustration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:22Z (GMT).

We also examine whether parent learning partner roles are associated with children's opportunity to experiment with digital production activities. Based on earlier ethnographic studies we predicted that there would be variability of the number of roles played across our sample, and that parents active in the technology industry would play more roles, especially those potentially catalyzed by some level of expertise or knowledge, such as teaching, modeling practice, collaborating on technical projects, or lending resources. Our findings were consistent with these hypotheses. For both mothers and fathers, the level of technology use at work was associated with the diversity of learning partner roles. Counts of the diversity and density of parent roles was significantly associated with the breadth of children's experience with digital production activities.

Drawing on sociocultural theorizing, Bakhtinian inspired notion of the ""dialogic space"", and material-discursive onto- epistemology, we introduce the concept of social object to explain how material objects can turn into joint attention and meaning-making in ongoing interaction. Video recordings (75 hours) of 94 students' aged 9 to 12 years old and their teachers' interactions in the makerspace were analyzed. The study shows how the material objects of the makerspace were enacted into social objects via joint attention about the objects, around the objects and with the objects. The study demonstrates the need to rethink the meaning and role of material objects in novel educational makerspaces for establishing and negotiating joint attention, mediating learning opportunities and tensions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:23Z (GMT).

Our approach to addressing this question is multimodal, involving two sources of data: (a) a record of students' online conversations, and (b) the frequency and duration with which documents were open on each student's screen. This study suggests that in this specific case, relatively thin data about reading frequency and mean reading duration can be used to make inferences about students' reading behavior in a CSCL context where it is impossible to observe directly. It also shows the power of a multimodal approach to the data--here, we are using one mode of data (discussion) to get a better understanding of another mode (clickstream).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:23Z (GMT).

Despite the significant interest in making-&amp;- tinkering activities, most of the research has focused on implementations in non-formal and informal educational settings, with learners of older age (i.e., students in secondary school). The present study sought to investigate young students' knowledge gains, attitudes towards a making-&amp;-tinkering approach to learning mathematics in formal education and the development of 21st-century skills as they engaged in a collaborative making-&amp;-tinkering project using a variety of arts, crafts, and technological tools such as a physical robot. The making-&amp;-tinkering approach involved making, tinkering, programming, and play in a group project integrated into the formal mathematics curriculum. Findings from the study suggest that young students can greatly benefit from such an approach. The study has demonstrated the applicability and value of such methods for young learners in formal educational contexts, with implications for future research and practice in the field.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:24Z (GMT).

Benefits were viewed as complementary or supplementary to face-to-face program components and context. Parent access to information about their children not available to them during program participation may deepen understanding and strengthen feelings of connectedness, particularly important to parent-teacher relationships. While there was synergy on most platform benefits, teachers did not observe parents' value in maintaining the program climate of trust and safety, and extending feelings of community. These may be essential for the platform to represent the learning supports aligned with the offline program experience. Study findings lead to hypotheses on the role of an online environment in parents' mental models of programs for collaborative learning, and in social presence that strengthen collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:24Z (GMT).

However, in a collaborative learning session, students engage in a range of behaviors and it can be difficult to indicate which of those behaviors correlate with higher outcomes. In this paper, we propose using Extreme Value Theory (EVT), a method that considers the data points in the tail (upper or lower) of the distribution, to analyse the relationship between collaborative process variables and outcome measures through insights derived from high impact, low-frequency events. Specifically, in this paper, we analyse the relationship between dual gaze patterns and outcome measures across two different datasets. In both datasets we found that students with lower outcomes had lower focus during the collaborative session. This paper provides a contribution by both introducing EVT as a viable method for analysing CSCL data as well as demonstrating the effectiveness of eye- tracking as a collaborative indicator to use to adapt to in real-time.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:24Z (GMT).

One aspect of context is the notion of disciplines such as science, math, and the language arts (Sawyer, 2006). To date, however, research that explores the relationship between knowledge and disciplinary context has typically focused within a single disciplinary frame, such as science (e.g., Banks et al., 2007). This paper aims to explore the influence of disciplinary boundaries between science and language arts on students' developing practices. We present data from a mixed-age first and second grade classroom where students collaboratively engaged with a book about honeybees from either a science or a language arts frame. Analyses of students' individual written critiques reveal how they consistently adapted their criteria for what makes a good representation based upon the disciplinary framing.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:24Z (GMT).

Mobile eye-trackers, physiological wristbands and motion sensors captured their behavior and social interactions. In this paper, I leverage prior work on joint visual attention (Tomasello, 1995) and analyze the eye-tracking data collected during the study. This paper provides three contributions: 1) I use an emerging methodology to capture joint visual attention in a co-located setting using mobile eye-trackers (Schneider &amp; al., 2018); 2) I then replicate findings showing that levels of joint visual attention are positively correlated with collaboration quality; 3) finally, I present a new measure that captures cycles of collaborative / individual work, which is positively associated with learning gains (but not with collaboration quality). I discuss these results and conclude with implications for capturing students' interactions in co- located spaces using Multimodal Learning Analytics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:24Z (GMT).

The availability of valid instruments and norms for CPS achievement would also promote CSCL adoption within the wider education arena. This study explores two methods of assessing CPS: using the ATC21S online tasks and using qualitative discourse analysis of the same groups of students' transactions as they work together on an authentic learning task. By comparing the measurements arising from both methods, we raise issues and contradictions observed and suggest further research directions related to the measurement of CPS.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:25Z (GMT).

We show how the participants used many source concepts in the exploration of the abstract concept of `thinking', and were able to build a conceptual synthetizing metaphor. Our results support a bimodal metaphors salience hypothesis: metaphorical gestures play a great role in making reasoning visible to others and therefore fostering collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:25Z (GMT).

However, these social processes and their influence on teachers' learning (i.e., adopting new practices) are notoriously hard to study, given their implicit and informal nature. In this paper, we apply the Knowledge Appropriation Model (KAM) to trace how different social processes relate with the implementation of pedagogical innovations in the classroom (as a marker of professional learning), through the analysis of more than 20,000 artifacts from Go-Lab, an online community to support inquiry-based learning. Our results not only show how different social processes like sharing or co-creation seem to be related to increased classroom implementation. Also, they provide insights on how we can use traces from digital co-creation platforms, to better understand the social dimension of professional learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:25Z (GMT).

We conducted an analysis of a curated subset of more than 540,000 comments of Youtube videos to explore how users participate and practice in discussions about Minecraft where comment boxes are the primary method used to communicate about video content. Our findings reveal that gamers use online comment sections for multiple reasons, from participating in shared social experiences unique to Youtube as a community to giving myriad forms of feedback to learn and further content development. In our discussion, we address the ways other online game platforms can better support learners seeking out information and collaborating in ways that are constructive and inclusive.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:25Z (GMT).

While a growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness of such an approach, there is great variation in defining the specific strategies and approaches, making it difficult to advance the field. We examined 19 college instructors for over 220 hours using AL methods. We coded the observed classroom activities according to teacher- and student-centered behaviours. On average, these teachers allocated over 50% of class time to group work. A cluster analysis revealed four distinct patterns of student-centred activity: (1) frequent, short duration; (2) longer duration; (3) less frequent, short duration; and, (4) mixed. Two approaches to workflow were identified: 1) tightly orchestrated and 2) front-loaded with less structured periods of work. Results suggest typologies of instructional patterns, growth trajectories and new directions for examining AL.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:25Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Two 5th grade learners were recorded as they worked together to program and navigate a robot across a 3'x3' grid of obstacles. The video was then analyzed using a grounded theory approach (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) to determine how cognition manifested in an embodied manner (e.g., gesturing, use of conceptual metaphor) through the tools and affordances employed by the learners. Four primary tools were used by learners in solving their robotics task: (1) basic robot moves, (2) gestures, (3) the map and the computer, and (4), the grid and the robot. These tools provided symbolic access to direct experiences, supporting an emergent and reactive process in which perception and action were intimately linked.

Examining observations from three introductory computer science classrooms, we address the following research questions: (1) How and what kinds of peer-to-peer collaborations emerged in unstructured ways, especially around bugs in open-ended projects? and (2) What curricular, spatial, social, and teacher supports allowed these interactions to emerge and flourish? In the discussion, we consider implications for supporting similar types of emergent collaborative learning in open-ended computational making designs.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:26Z (GMT).

In this paper, we report the design and outcomes of professional development activities that support teachers and researchers to collaboratively customize Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE) units to help students develop coherent science knowledge. The WISE units and professional development activities were developed using the Knowledge Integration (KI) Framework. We show that the KI framework functioned as an effective scaffold to support teachers in modifying their teaching practice to make curriculum customizations that are evidence-based and aligned with a theory of learning. We discuss how our study results informed the design of an online curriculum customization and implementation interface and offer the principles of the KI framework as design principles for the development of other collaborative professional development endeavors.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:26Z (GMT).

Teachers thus organise their thinking, workflow and classroom interactions using textbooks. However, text media limit students' ability to imagine the dynamics embedded in mathematics and science formalisms, such as vectors. We outline an affordable design that augments textbooks, to: allow all students to imagine such dynamics; help teachers reorganize their thinking and workflow; make all classrooms highly collaborative. The design consists of a 'touchy-feely vector' system (smartphone-based manipulation of vectors), a 'virtual lesson plan' (manipulable simulations that extend textbook figures), and a 'mixed-media' textbook (QR codes pasted next to figures, linked to manipulable simulations). We discuss how this integrated design changed learning and teaching practices, based on an ethnographic study of experimental and control classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:27Z (GMT).

Yet, how to guide uses of peers' ideas, and what the impacts of those ideas are on students' learning, are open questions. We implemented a web-based cell biology unit with 116 grade 7 students, and explored how peers' ideas are used during explanation building, and how prompts to draw on peers to either diversify or reinforce existing ideas impacted the quality of students' written explanations. Among other findings, exchanging ideas with peers led to all students improving their explanation quality upon revision; and students prompted to diversify their ideas showed greater learning gains by the end of the unit, while students prompted to reinforce ideas, who used more peer-generated ideas in preparation to write their explanations, produced higher quality explanations. This study builds our understanding of the influence of peer ideas on learning, and offers insight into supporting students in engaging effectively with peers' ideas.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:27Z (GMT).

AEP employs evidence-based teaching practices (e.g., formative assessment, universal design for learning) to address college students' diverse learning needs (i.e., their strengths, interests, and areas for growth). AEP provides collaborative computer- supported project-based opportunities that enable students to extend the application of course concepts to embedded contexts that engage them as learners. To compare AEP and active- learning control conditions, this study utilizes identical measures: validated surveys, interviews, observation notes, anonymous course-feedback forms, and formative and summative assessments. Multivariate regression analyses suggest that students learning through AEP outperformed control conditions by a full letter grade and scored on average 14.20 percentage- points higher on final assessments, when controlling for disability status, gender, and pre-test achievement. AEP has a large standardized effect size on the final (d=2.40) and provides a framework to improve student success through embedded and extended learning opportunities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:27Z (GMT).

However, a teacher's presence hinders student collaboration in some cultural contexts, and some students may not have a teacher or knowledgeable adult who can provide this support. We conducted an experiment with K-1 students (N=36) in a rural Tanzanian village, where we trained students to provide technology support for their peers under different experimental conditions. We found that with basic technical training and social awareness of the assigned leaders, students can indeed provide peer support in the absence of a teacher, and additionally enable collaboration. We challenge the popularly held notion that natural leaders will emerge and support students' technology and learning needs without adequate training, and discuss the implications of our findings in the deployment of technologies in similar socio-cultural contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:27Z (GMT).

We used the pre- and post-test data from 361 eighth grade students (102 groups) and performed a hierarchical linear model analysis to examine how the convergence or divergence in the students' level of prior knowledge affected students' learning outcomes. We found that students in homogenous groups with similar levels of initial prior knowledge scored significantly higher on their post-test when their pre-test was used as a covariate, than students in heterogeneous groups.

Microblogs like Twitter have the potential for engaging citizens in civic discourse about such issues but also pose challenges due to partisan behaviors and length limitations. Given the saliency of social media in young people's lives, we examined in an exploratory study whether integrating a 140-character limit within an audience response system supported high school students' argumentation about socioscientific issues during a synthetic biology workshop. After analyzing students' anonymous online responses, worksheets, and observations, we found that students generated diverse evaluative claims as well as used argument-based rationales and weighed counter arguments when assessing their peers' claims. In our discussion, we address the affordances and constraints of microblogging in supporting students' argumentation of socioscientific issues about synthetic biology.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:28Z (GMT).

A key design involved students writing on KF inquiring into knowledge- building principles and meta-talk on the processes. Results indicated that the students engaged in productive online discourse on both domain and discourse understanding progressively. Classroom analyses suggested how students engaged in meta-talk and inquiry into principles with corresponding change in the knowledge about discourse.

Science inquiry also tends to involve faraway locales, distant from students' extensive everyday knowledge of surrounding spaces and places (Barton &amp; Tan, 2009). In this paper, we share findings from the most recent iteration of a larger design-based research project that directly engaged elementary students in modeling a local complex ecological system, the soil ecology underfoot in the schoolyard. We examine how 5th grade students used interactive GIS maps in whole class discussions, moving between their everyday experiences in the schoolyard, the data collection experience, and the classes' aggregated data in reasoning about complex socio-ecological relationships and explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:29Z (GMT).

This study looks at ongoing design-based research efforts to engage bilingual students in helping their teachers become more capable of communicating in Spanish. Through online-delivered challenges teachers and students work together to complete a series of tasks that help teachers learn about communicating across cultures and preparing several communication-aids to help them reach out more frequently. Through a narrative profile analysis, we uncovered the types of influences the five-week intervention can have on teacher's home communication efforts, beliefs in their own ability to develop stronger language skills, and relationships with students, and we trace the implications these efforts have on teacher practice, design iterations, and scaling.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:29Z (GMT).

Studies and assessments were developed to conceptualize and to measure CPS skills. Most studies operationalized different dimensions of CPS skills as discrete measures even though they may be interweaving in the construct. In this study we went beyond the separate measures on the different dimensions and focused on the connections among these skills. Using log data of 20,947 events on actions and chats from 43 teams, we studied how different dimensions of CPS skills were connected as reflected in problem solving. CPS skill networks were constructed to capture the co-occurrence of the skills in turns during collaboration. The results showed that teams with high and low performance had significantly different CPS network structures.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:30Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Within a coaching cycle, teachers and coaches met to plan a mathematics lesson, the teacher video recorded the lesson, the coach and teacher both annotated the lesson video, and finally the two met to debrief the lesson verbally. We report on the process of video annotations. Data analysis focused on identifying the type of response within an annotation as well as the extent to which the teacher or coach noticed students' mathematical thinking. We contend that the annotation process afforded opportunities for direct suggestions to teachers that may not have otherwise occurred.

To achieve this, we applied a double-layered socio-semantic network analysis (SSNA). In the first layer of the analysis, we conducted an SSNA to numerically represent collective knowledge advancement and to compare group performances between different levels of learning outcomes. In the second layer, we carried out an Epistemic Network Analysis to examine the relationship between students' shared epistemic agency and learning outcomes. The results revealed that high learning-outcome groups were engaged in epistemic actions to generate new ideas; this led them to quick and sustainable knowledge advancement.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:30Z (GMT).

To be successful, the learning must be enacted (in classrooms), but the community is ephemeral. To investigate whether participants on one large online teacher professional development (OTPD) site were hampered in forming community, or overcame these barriers, this study interviewed members of the PD site to get at their sense of community. Using grounded theory, the transcripts of the interviews were coded to reveal members' perceptions of community in this online space. Results suggest that most consider themselves as part of the community, and, importantly, see this as a space in which to share material resources. The results have implications for understanding and augmenting the role of OTPD in supporting professional learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:31Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

To address this gap, we draw from sociocultural theorizing, with a specific interest in the notions of funds of knowledge and knowledge creation. We ask: how do the students' funds of knowledge mediate their knowledge creation during STEM learning in a novel computer-supported makerspace? Our findings indicate three forms of knowledge creation during STEM learning: ""horizontal knowledge creation"", ""vertical knowledge creation"", and ""extended knowledge creation"". Our work joins with the line of research focused on complex intersection between students' funds of knowledge and schooled knowledge in a third space. It makes visible how a novel computer-supported makerspace makes available a repertoire of digital, material and social resources that can advance the emergence of creative third spaces.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:31Z (GMT).

We propose three dimensions: reliability, learnability and critical-construction, as a framework for investigating collaborative learning within naturally occurring social media. We use YouTube as a focal case. Our review of literature on YouTube as a space for informal peer learning suggests that post- video deliberative comments hold much promise as precursors for co-construction of knowledge. However, questions remain concerning the veracity of user-contributed videos, and the adequacy of this medium for different learning goals. Nonetheless, investigating the educative value of non-formal person-to-person knowledge sharing on social media can be an important direction for CSCL research in its aim to support learners in formal environments for future life-long learning and civic engagement.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:32Z (GMT).

Two types of epistemic scaffolding are differentiated based on existing literature and educational practices, namely, implicit and explicit epistemic scaffolding. Implicit epistemic scaffolding refers to the support (including tool, activities, resources, etc.) that has epistemic implications but is not made obvious to learners. Explicit epistemic scaffolding refers to the support that intentionally makes epistemic ideas explicit to learners to promote their epistemic understanding. Many of the CSCL environments have been designed with epistemic underpinnings, which could serve as implicit epistemic scaffolds. We propose that embedding explicit epistemic scaffolds in CSCL environments that are designed with implicit epistemic scaffolds is a promising way to maximize the power of support for epistemic growth.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:32Z (GMT).

A key component to developing the community for collaboration was the use of online global meet-ups, or facilitated video conference sessions where participants from different sites share projects and feedback. Meet-ups were key to establishing social trust and motivating project collaboration across sites. This paper examines participant discourse at different stages of the community formation process. Data from three online meetings with U.S. and Kenyan students were analyzed using epistemic network analysis (ENA). Findings show significant changes in the patterns of discourse corresponding to the development of the community over time. The initial emphasis on self-awareness and superficial information sharing shifted toward peer teaching and knowledge acquisition after six months. These observations demonstrate how the depth of interactions within online global meet-up culture evolved into more substantive interactions towards collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:33Z (GMT).

The discourse from a meet-up between students in Kenya and the U.S was coded with these global competences. Epistemic network analysis (ENA) is used to evaluate for meaningful connections between the codes. Upon analysis of the data, lifelong learning and trans-disciplinarity exhibit the strongest connection, which supports the fundamental goals of the project fostering critical thinking among students globally through media-making and discussion of STEM subjects. Furthermore, the two groups of students Kenyan and American demonstrated different strengths; the Kenyan students focused on self-agency and using diverse tools, while American students were content-driven. These complementary behaviors collectively exemplify the seven global competences and are an example of building skillsets for future workforce environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:33Z (GMT).

The research study investigates the ways in which these learning experiences impact girls' development of CT; interest and attitudes toward computer science; and their understandings of how participation in creation with technology impacts themselves and the world around them. Utilizing a qualitative multi-site case study design, the study found that a connected learning approach boosted the development of girls' CT skills, positively impacted attitudes towards computing pathways/careers, and increased understandings of computational participation. In addition, the educational experiences happening throughout the SciGirls Code program exemplifies the 4E learning model. Implications include how technology can be leveraged towards creating an inherently collaborative setting, acknowledging social, emotional, cultural, technological, and cognitive intersections in learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:33Z (GMT).

The goal of this systematic review is to identify gaps in methodological effort of quantifying human interactions and communication in terms of research contexts, levels of analysis, and time points of assessment. In synthesizing information on these three aspects, we hope to identify trends over the years and encourage more effort in less researched areas.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:33Z (GMT).

In this work, we investigate the feasibility of predicting the quality of collaboration among a group of students working together to solve a math problem from human-labelled collaboration indicators. We use a corpus of 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students working in groups of three to solve math problems collaboratively. Researchers labelled both the group-level collaboration quality during each problem and the student-level collaboration indicators. Results using random forests reveal that the individual indicators of collaboration aid in the prediction of group collaboration quality.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:34Z (GMT).

Using a quasi-experiment design, we collected: (a) students' online Knowledge Building be- haviors, (b) group reading discussions, and (c) students' reading comprehension assessment. Our findings reveal that the experimental group (Knowledge Building) outperformed the con- trol group (direct instruction) on the comprehension assessment.

Cohesion Network Analysis (CNA) can be employed by instructors to analyze discourse structure in terms of cohesive links in order to model student participation and interactions in collaborative learning environments. This paper presents an extended longitudinal analysis together with corresponding visualizations of participation generated for an online math course, powered by CNA. Multiple interactive views centered on the evolution of participation and of interactions between students clustered into three layers are generated using the CNA indices provided by the ReaderBench framework. Two types of sociograms are used to show the interactions between learners in the two course weeks that exhibited extreme conditions, namely: a) week 6, when a dramatic decrease of participation was identified, and b) week 16, when the highest number of participants and contributions were logged. In addition to the views centered on participants, we introduce a heatmap depicting the evolution of keyword relevance over time, as well as a Chord diagram for visualizing concept maps based on semantic relatedness. Our analytics dashboard can be used by tutors to monitor students throughout the term and to better ascertain the correlation of course material, schedule, and deadlines with the participation of students, as well as their interactions among themselves and with the tutor.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:35Z (GMT).

To do so, an online peer feedback system was designed and developed. They were then asked to write and argumentative essay (individually), to engage in argumentative peer feedback with their learning partner (collaboratively), and finally to revise their essays based on feedback which received (individually).

Such skills refer to the students' use of language as a tool to enable understanding of each other's knowledge, which creates the possibility of constructing new knowledge together. Digital technology in classroom activities can support this form of dialogue, but it must be embedded into a classroom's complex ecosystem to be beneficial. This paper explores how a group of seventh grade students were taught dialogic skills through the integration of microblogging in the classroom. The data analysed consists of video from the classroom, and the study is grounded in sociocultural theory. Findings suggest that integrating microblogging in classroom activities increased participation and made students' contributions more visible, thus creating the opportunity for students to build on each other's knowledge. However, this is dependent on the teachers' facilitation of the activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This paper describes how families use technology and new media for multi-tasking in order to collaboratively accomplish many routine tasks around their homes. Families employ a number of approaches to media multi-tasking, and their sociotechnical practices reflect how children learn to multi-task, learn through multi-tasking, and learn despite multi-tasking. I draw on these practices to explain how families manage shared- and divergent -objects of activity at home, and how technology is implicated in this maintenance work. I offer a multi-dimensional framework for multi-tasking that suggests how determining what is consequential for learning with technology is often contingent on a number of tools, tasks, purposes, and people.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:36Z (GMT).

The practices for doing so are opaque, analog, expensive, inefficient, and entrenched. This makes schools resistant to embodied, enactive, extended, and embedded collaborative learning. Digital badges can contain (a) specific claims about such broad learning, (b) web-enabled digital evidence supporting those claims, and (c) information about how that evidence was obtained. Badges can then circulate this information readily in social networks where they can gain additional meaning. This paper explores how CSCL goals might be served by using badges to shift towards capturing, recognizing, endorsing, and motivating learning, and doing so for a much broader range of learning than otherwise possible.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:36Z (GMT).

We tested three versions of the design: (a) individual sensorimotor enactment only, (b) individual and then collaborative enactments, and (c) individual enactment and then collaborative description followed by enactment. As our first case showed, the required sensorimotor coordination was developed but never used in the following problem solving when a student worked alone. In contrast, in both collaborative cases the relevant sensorimotor coordination became a part of instrumented action scheme.

However, there is a lack of research investigating how students manage uncertainties during a collaborative design process and how effective uncertainty management skills may be developed in the learners. In this paper, we present the results of a pilot study investigating how middle school students collaboratively manage uncertainties while solving an engineering design challenge. We also discuss issues related to the management strategies used and reflect on how these issues can be addressed using a computer-supported collaborative learning environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:37Z (GMT).

Learners collaboratively or individually generated a diagram that represented energy flow (constructive scaffold) or observed a peer learner generating the diagram (example-based scaffold). We hypothesized that collaborative learners would benefit more from the constructive than the example-based scaffold, but that the opposite would be the case for individual learners. Seventy-one university students were randomly allocated to conditions in the 2X2 between-subjects design. Climate change understanding was measured at pre- and posttest. Preliminary results supported our hypothesis. We conclude that the constructive scaffold elicited questions that led to deep engagement in the collaborative condition, resulting in better understanding. Individual learners possibly failed to recognize crucial concepts in the constructive condition because they had questions but nobody to discuss with. They profited more from the example-based scaffold which emphasized central concepts of climate change.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Emergent leadership can improve group functioning, but this depends on how leadership is supported by group members. We studied how roles emerged in two groups of eighth-graders participating in CSCL activities over a 12-week science unit. A leader emerged in each group, but through different processes. Group A showed greater distribution of contributions to decision-making and science talk than Group B, as well as greater conceptual gains on a content test. In contrast, Group B focused more on off-task talk than Group A. While our sample is too small to make causal claims, better distribution of contributions to talk and on-task participation seemed to positively impact collaboration and learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:37Z (GMT).

However, it's still unclear how specific features of play orient students towards scientific modeling and thus science learning. We investigate how the organization of an activity where students pretend to be bees to learn about how bees pollinate might direct their attention either to treating these activities as play or to exploring the underlying rules about how bees behave in the real world in a manner more akin to modeling. We describe three activities where students appear to have engaged in different kinds of play and explore how their actions and teachers' orientation produced either playful rules or scientific accounts. The implications of this work will support teachers and researchers in organizing embodied play activities that help students engage with scientific concepts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:38Z (GMT).

Participants were 38 college students enrolled in an ""Introduc- tion to Living Technology"" course at a Taiwanese university. They were randomly assigned to eight groups. Each group discussed their design ideas in a computer-supported collaborative knowledge-building environment - called Knowledge Forum (KF) - to collaboratively design a product. Data includes students' design discussion in KF and analysis focused on online knowledge-building activities and groups' design-thinking modes. In general, knowledge- building activities cultivated students in design-thinking modes during the design process as a group. Specifically, the extent to which groups sustained online engagement and the advance- ment of their group knowledge had a major impact on their design performance.

A total of 40 teaching assistants participated in a 4- hour teaching training session, during which they were randomly assigned to a VR-supported and a live simulation group. Participants reported significantly higher teaching self-efficacy after the training. The VR participatory simulation better promoted the post-session, lab- teaching knowledge test performance than the live simulation. `Bicentric' perspective taking embedded in VR-based interactions facilitated both experiential and vicarious learning. Yet a concurrent hybrid presence framed by the virtual and physical collocation of participants exerted an over-reliance on individual autonomy in VR simulation-based collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:39Z (GMT).

The purpose of this study was to explore how two different studio art classes used a VDS environment to engage in studio practices and online critique processes. Through data analytics and thematic analysis, this study investigated how students collaborate during the critique process in a VDS environment. The results are supported in three ways: (1) VDS technology afforded viewing and the critique of artifacts, (2) the VDS failed to support dynamic peer collaboration, and (3) students sought technology alternatives to engage in deeper discussion. These findings aim to increase the effectiveness of VDS and expand the methods of online student collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:40Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Sixth- grade students working in pairs (N = 78) were randomly assigned to either a choice or no- choice condition for investigating the insulation effectiveness of different materials. The choice students were asked to select one of two equivalent scenarios to investigate with the experimentation model. In contrast, the no-choice students were randomly assigned a scenario to investigate. Our findings indicate that the choice students more often used the model to test their prior ideas than their no-choice peers. Furthermore, the choice students also ran more informative experimentation test patterns that yielded valid and useful data for understanding heat energy transfer with the model. The findings from this study provide promising insights into the potentially beneficial impact of incorporating choice into science learners' experiences in the classroom.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:40Z (GMT).

Traditional research on group formation has investigated mostly separate learner characteristics as preconditions of learning. Combinations of different learner characteristics and of learner characteristics with collaborative processes have been less in focus. Considering such combinations is necessary to represent the complexity of group interactions and learning. Despite the digitalization of learning, there has been only few attempts to investigate the diagnostic information that mining learner texts and learning processes can contribute to addressing this complexity for optimal group formation, and to assign groups automatically based on multiple parameters simultaneously. This symposium brings together a multi-disciplinary and international consortium of researchers who all focus on group formation for computer supported collaborative learning. They complement each other in investigating different combinations of learner characteristics, learning processes and automatic techniques for optimal group formation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:40Z (GMT).

The Geniventure game was developed to support student learning of core concepts in genetics via challenges that engage students with genetic phenomena at the molecular level. A core feature of the game is that it simulates behavior of molecular entities (genes, proteins, organelles) with high disciplinary fidelity to how these mechanisms really operate in the cell. In this sense, it is deeply disciplinary. The commitment to disciplinary fidelity presents design challenges regarding the ways in which entities, activities, and mechanisms are represented and manipulated in the game across the biological organization levels. We discuss five distinct types of design challenges that we identified based on data from focus groups with students who played the game and provide design heuristics for addressing these challenges.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:41Z (GMT).

Despite the powerful potential for cross-fostering of ideas between these fields, one key question arising inquires whether educational scientists--who focus on the interventionist, design-based study of learning--and social scientists, who concentrate on analytic study of spontaneous social interaction and knowledge construction, can engage in a productive collaboration. This symposium seeks to address this question by adopting an interdisciplinary lens, through which these perspectives have been integrated, or at least juxtaposed, to develop new insights regarding what it means to learn in an information-based networked society. Six interdisciplinary research projects that represent lessons learned from synergistic projects among researchers from these fields are presented in this symposium.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:41Z (GMT).

This symposium features four projects in which teachers and researchers engaged in technology-mediated collaboration to design inquiry-based learning environments to engage students in authentic disciplinary practices in a variety of content areas, including literary reading, literacy in mathematics, science, and engineering design. The size and scope of the collaborations vary, ranging from one-to-one to larger groups, as does the time span of the collaborations, providing opportunities to examine temporal affordances of technology supports. All four papers discuss collaborative co-design as sites of professional learning for teachers. We argue that these are excellent cases of CSCL and that they afford new insights into roles for technology in supporting and facilitating teacher and researcher learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:42Z (GMT).

Disciplinary engagement is critical for fostering students' deep, integrated understanding of STEM content and disciplinary practices. However, there are significant challenges to reaching this engagement quality, with CSCL environments providing opportunities and supports for engagement, but also posing challenges. This symposium aims to account for recent developments, as presenters showcase rich range in exploring application of PDE in diverse domains, grade bands, and learning contexts. The presentations also showcase a range of methods to analyze PDE as collective, situated, cross-contextual, dynamic, and generative.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:43Z (GMT).

Syntheses of CSCL research can help to answer questions about the prevalent topics and outcomes in the field. There are a number of synthesis methods to choose depending on the methods used in the primary studies as well as goals of the synthesis. Meta-synthesis is also available to better integrate findings obtained using different research methods. This symposium showcases a spectrum of different synthesis methods used in CSCL.

Findings revealed significant differences in how teachers perceive PD delivery format; experienced teachers had positive perceptions of face-to-face PD while newer teachers had positive perceptions of online PD.

However, these learners often encounter conflicts that may arise based on the learning task itself or on external factors. Little is known about the nature and evolution of conflicts that occur when elementary learners work together. To investigate this phenomenon, we analyzed videos of six pairs of students completing a programming activity. We identified four stages of conflict: initiation, escalation, de-escalation, and conclusion. Our analysis showed that the conflicts typically began around disagreements about code, who should have control of the keyboard and mouse, and other interpersonal events. Also, we found that some pairs of students resolved their conflicts through self-explanation and listening while others did not take advantage of those constructive strategies. This research reveals some ways in which conflicts evolve between elementary learners, and how we may be able to support them in conflict resolution while solving problems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:48Z (GMT).

However, there still is a lack of research on how these innovations can be used by teachers and learners, as most existing systems are restricted to experimental research setups.

As the experience of some emotions (e.g., anxiety, shame, and fear) may be maladaptive to learning, it is important to raise learners' awareness of their emotions and their peers' emotions and support them in reacting timely and wisely in response to such emotions. To this end, we conducted an authentic study to identify learners' practices and preferences regarding their awareness of the types of academic emotions they experience and the extent to which they share such emotions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:52Z (GMT).

In this study we evaluate the balance between type of guidance and learner characteristics while collaborative learning with agent-based models takes place. Participants were students from health-care programs and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: one group learned with agent-based models using the vicarious approach, where pairs viewed and discussed recordings of others using agent-based models; the other group explored agent-based models while discussing in pairs a set of text-based prompts. The results reveal that the vicarious-learning approach was superior to agent-based models' exploration. More detailed evaluation shows that nursing students' performance wasn't affected by the type of guidance, while less experienced in the content, non-nursing students, benefited more from vicarious guidance. Findings suggest that dialoguing while observing the dialogue of others can maximize immediate learning gains.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:55Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Traditional MOOCs are not designed for collaboration and social interaction among participants that build communities, which has been shown to be an important aspect of effective PD. This study provides insights in designing for collaboration on a traditional MOOC platform (in our case edX). A pilot study was run with a small group of in-service teachers to test a collaborative design with an eye to how the design will scale to a full MOOC. Objectives and theoretical framework There is a growing need among teachers for greater access to effective, on-demand, low-cost professional development (PD) (Fishman et al., 2013). Traditional face-to-face PD is expensive, and limited in relevance, applicability, and ability to scale (Hill, 2015). Online PD is a rapidly growing option that can make it more broadly accessible. PD offered online can be as successful as face-to-face (Fishman et al., 2013). Massive open online courses (MOOCs) provide the opportunity to explore the viability of such online approaches at larger scales. However, there are drawbacks to MOOC participation that pose barriers to implementing effective PD. collaboration among participants and social interaction that build communities are two conditions that encourage engagement but are not well-supported technologically in MOOCs (Kop, 2011). We seek to design a MOOC that overcomes these barriers to collaboration and community building. In order to do this research, a pilot study was run with a small group of teachers in order to explore how successfully a MOOC platform and framework can be used to encourage collaboration with the aim of eventually scaling to larger participation. We build on research that positions teachers as knowers and agents of change (Cochran-Smith &amp; Lytle, 1999). This posits that teachers are active participants in building their own knowledge rather than passive recipients (Fenstermacher, 1994). Through a cross-case study Booth (2012) found that social learning was able to build knowledge sharing and trust among teachers. Other studies have demonstrated that collaboration can increase knowledge creation and sharing in an online space (e.g., Duncan-Howell, 2010). In order to encourage collaboration in our SPOC, we built on existing best practices for encouraging collaboration in online PD (e.g. Booth, 2012; Hew &amp; Cheung, 2014). These findings were used directly in the development of the collaborative learning portion of the course and the prompts that led teachers into that space. Methods This paper is part of a long-standing program of research funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation which undertakes the design and dissemination of a curriculum to teach common topics in high school biology through complex systems simulations (Yoon et al., 2017). In adapting the PD for the complex systems curriculum to a wider audience, the PD was moved to an online platform: Edge, the pilot testing platform for edX. We used three design categories which emerged from the literature to promote collaboration throughout the course: 1) periodic required discussions in the online forum; 2) open-ended questions based on course content to prompt the sharing of reflections on practice; and 3) expectation of participant comments on others' reflections. The participants in the first implementation of the course were eight in-service teachers from six different schools in three urban districts in the Northeastern US. This paper is part of a larger study which collects data at both the teacher and student level over an entire year. A selection of the data from the summer PD was analyzed: teacher enrollment forms, teacher interviews, and teacher post-surveys were used as primary sources of data, while preliminary data from the discussion board posts was used to triangulate some of the findings. We combined the open-ended responses from the enrollment forms, satisfaction surveys, and interview transcripts which were all then inductively mined for themes. The themes were given positive and negative levels and a coding manual was created representing the themes and","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:57Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Here we are referring to formative feedback, dialogic interactions either among that focus on the whole process of creation (Bangert, 2004). In this paper, we share results from a design experiment that included the introduction of asynchronous, digital feedback into a making process. This making process, a six-week project with a group of fifth graders is described in other work (Litts &amp; Halverson, in press). Here, we ask the following research questions: What is the role of asynchronous, digital feedback in young people's maker projects?

We seek to understand how specific gestural interactions may be tied to particular instances of learning supported by embodiment. To help us investigate this question, we built a tabletop prototype that facilitates collaborative science learning from data visualizations and used this prototype as a testbed in a laboratory study with 11 family groups. We present an analysis of the types of gestural interactions that accompanied embodied cognition (as revealed by users' language) while learners interacted with our prototype. Our preliminary findings indicate a positive role of cooperative (multi- user) gestures in supporting scientific discussion and collaborative meaning-making during embodied cognition. Our next steps are to continue our analysis to identify additional touchscreen interaction design guidelines for learning technologies, so that designers can capitalize on the affordances of embodied cognition in these contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:03:59Z (GMT).

We investigate how these processes are interactionally accomplished in and across intertextually tied events where devised, generated, accessed, curated and appropriated digital texts are connected in webs of meaning. The concepts of multimodality and intertextuality from literacy studies provide explanatory theories to investigate how digital texts in the developing dialogic space are consequential the learning process across the phases of a PBL cycle.

However, studies rarely address instructional approaches to develop students' skills of learning with these resources. It is also the case that the nature of student engagement when they use representations in their learning is rarely examined. We report preliminary findings of a systematic review on the nature of student engagement when using multiple representations. Our analysis resulted in 4 categories of student engagement revealing various levels of learner agency. Results provide insight for research and practice in designing and understanding learning with multiple representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:04:05Z (GMT).

However, little research shows how such technology influences dynamic family interactions in the home over time. An in-the-wild study was conducted in six family homes over three weeks. An Alexa, with a number of skills, was set up in each home for the families to use. The findings showed differences in use over time. To begin, family cohesion behavior and family rituals were most prevalent. At the end of the study, the skills were found to motivate distinct family interaction patterns: including more collaboration to manage Alexa and scaffolding of children's interactions with Alexa, given developmental differences in users' grasp of Alexa's capabilities and limitations. We discuss how voice assistants support different interaction patterns and potentially, offer different learning opportunities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:04:09Z (GMT).

Building upon research work on the critical concept of ""epistemic territories"" as it has been developed within Conversational Analysis, we will highlight how request sequences for assistance project upcoming possible instructional activity.

In the classroom, RoomCast offers rapid redistribution of resources during teacher-initiated activity transitions, automatically distributing tailored sets of resources needed for the activity to heterogeneous client portals. While informed by research in technology supports for orchestration, RoomCast is not intended as a scripting tool for complex activity sequences.

Using examples from our work and from partner institutions, we will show how App Inventor has enabled learners from around the world to collaboratively engage in computational action. With an eye towards furthering App Inventor's support of computational action, this session will also highlight: 1) The recently developed support for real-time collaboration between students working at different computers; and 2) How different App Inventor components allow students to engage in embodied, enactive, extended and embedded learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:04:12Z (GMT).

Activities designed with Toccata are reusable, shareable and adaptable to the situation. Teachers face numerous challenges in designing and scripting pedagogical activities that incorporate rich media and applications, combine devices, group formations, and spaces. They also face challenges in orchestrating these activities in class, especially to guiding learners, following their progress, and maintaining a coherent learning experience. Our demonstration will showcase how Toccata answers these challenges by supporting individual or collaborative activities, in class or outdoors, under diverse technical conditions, e.g., offline on mobile devices, or fully connected with Desktop computers.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:04:12Z (GMT).

Research-practice partnerships and design-based research with teachers as co-designers is a key theme in this research programme. We argue the bridging concepts facilitate exchange both ways between theory and practice, and that the material outcome of the design incorporates and displays the ideas for future practice, and as such it contains the embryonic starting point of what `might be'.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-06-10T20:04:13Z (GMT).
