0,0,"Luehmann, April","A Theory of Design and One Successful Product Ã± An Effective Model of Technology-Supported Educational Programs","One Sky, Many Voices (OSMV), a research group from the University of Michigan, has successfully designed and works to continually refine an insightful and effective model of Internet-supported science curricula for middle-school students. Design, as a process, is an activity that requires the definition, articulation or development of multiple components such as user needs, design goals, and a potential solution in the form of a general model, to name a few. This paper highlights these key elements of design as well as the relationship between them. For example, research plays an integral role in the design efforts by One Sky Many Voices. When designing a system of elements that are intended to work together to accomplish some objective(s) (i.e., software and curriculum), an additional requirement of more global levels of expertise is discussed. To illustrate these ideas, the work of One Sky, Many Voices is introduced including their theoretical framework, research goals, design goals, resulting model and finally, a specific example of their success story, Kids as Global Scientists (KGS) '98.","Learner-Centered Design","Long

The goal is to lead students not only to understand the structure and functioning of the lathe, but also to use such a machine. To reach this, the prototype tries to foster conceptual changes in students' mental models and to increase students' control over the learning process. A series of experimental tests have been carried out to assess the educational validity of the instructional tool which has been devised. The aim of the first phase of the project was to assess whether students could use easily the virtual lathe and to verify what they learn about such a machine. The purpose of the second phase was to focus on some critical aspects of the learning process activated by using the virtual lathe in order to realize which are the instructional procedures which give the best learning outcomes.","Use of Advanced Visualizations in Learning","Long Paper","present,study,describes,prototypal,system,machine,tool,teaching,virtual,reality,environment,integrated,hypermedia,goal,lead,student,understand,structure,functioning,lathe,also,use,machine,reach,prototype,try,foster,conceptual,change,student,mental,model,increase,student,control,learning,process,series,experimental,test,carried,ass,educational,validity,instructional,tool,devised,aim,first,phase,project,ass,whether,student,could,use,easily,virtual,lathe,verify,learn,machine,purpose,second,phase,focus,critical,aspect,learning,process,activated,using,virtual,lathe,order,realize,instructional,procedure,give,best,learning,outcome","present study,study describes,describes prototypal,prototypal system,system machine,machine tool,tool teaching,teaching virtual,virtual reality,reality environment,environment integrated,integrated hypermedia,hypermedia goal,goal lead,lead student,student understand,understand structure,structure functioning,functioning lathe,lathe also,also use,use machine,machine reach,reach prototype,prototype try,try foster,foster conceptual,conceptual change,change student,student mental,mental model,model increase,increase student,student control,control learning,learning process,process series,series experimental,experimental test,test carried,carried ass,ass educational,educational validity,validity instructional,instructional tool,tool devised,devised aim,aim first,first phase,phase project,project ass,ass whether,whether student,student could,could use,use easily,easily virtual,virtual lathe,lathe verify,verify learn,learn machine,machine purpose,purpose second,second phase,phase focus,focus critical,critical aspect,aspect learning,learning process,process activated,activated using,using virtual,virtual lathe,lathe order,order realize,realize instructional,instructional procedure,procedure give,give best,best learning,learning outcome","present study describes,study describes prototypal,describes prototypal system,prototypal system machine,system machine tool,machine tool teaching,tool teaching virtual,teaching virtual reality,virtual reality environment,reality environment integrated,environment integrated hypermedia,integrated hypermedia goal,hypermedia goal lead,goal lead student,lead student understand,student understand structure,understand structure functioning,structure functioning lathe,functioning lathe also,lathe also use,also use machine,use machine reach,machine reach prototype,reach prototype try,prototype try foster,try foster conceptual,foster conceptual change,conceptual change student,change student mental,student mental model,mental model increase,model increase student,increase student control,student control learning,control learning process,learning process series,process series experimental,series experimental test,experimental test carried,test carried ass,carried ass educational,ass educational validity,educational validity instructional,validity instructional tool,instructional tool devised,tool devised aim,devised aim first,aim first phase,first phase project,phase project ass,project ass whether,ass whether student,whether student could,student could use,could use easily,use easily virtual,easily virtual lathe,virtual lathe verify,lathe verify learn,verify learn machine,learn machine purpose,machine purpose second,purpose second phase,second phase focus,phase focus critical,focus critical aspect,critical aspect learning,aspect learning process,learning process activated,process activated using,activated using virtual,using virtual lathe,virtual lathe order,lathe order realize,order realize instructional,realize instructional procedure,instructional procedure give,procedure give best,give best learning,best learning outcome"

Bowen||Ash, Katy","VR's Frames of Reference: A visualization technique for mastering abstract information spaces","This paper describes a research study that investigated how designers can use frames of reference (egocentric, exocentric, and a combination of the two) to support the mastery of complex multidimensional information. The primary focus of this study was the relationship between FORs and mastery; the secondary focus was on secondary factors (individual characteristics and interaction experience) that were likely to influence the relationship between FORs and mastery. This study provided useful knowledge about how we can use this feature to enhance VR and other visualization environments. Outcomes showed not only the extent to which different FORs facilitated the mastery of the abstract and multidimensional information spaces, but also provided insights into why this was the case. Three novel and meaningful findings were: (1) the bicentric group consistently outperformed the egocentric and exocentric groups, (2) the traditional pencil and paper test was biased in favor of the exocentric FOR, and (3) people exposed to the egocentric FOR had an enhanced ability to adopt this FOR when problem solving. Additionally, by examining the relationship between FORs and mastery within the context of individual characteristics and the interaction experiences, it was possible to derive a model describing this relationship in a broader context.","Use of Advanced Visualizations in Learning","Long

The accumulated empirical evidence is mixed at best, and could easily lead one to abandon the premise that animations are powerful vehicles for effectively conveying the dynamic behaviors of algorithms. However, we report on a research project based on the premise that a rethinking of algorithm animation design is required in order to harness its power to enhance learning. The key insight is that for algorithm animations to be effective, they have to be """"chunked"""" and embedded within a context and knowledge providing hypermedia information presentation system. The theoretical foundations of our approach, architecture of the resulting hypermedia algorithm visualization system, and empirical studies that show a significant advantage for the system over learning from text are described in this paper.

7,7,"Kafai, Yasmin||Ching, Cynthia Carter","Talking Science through Design: Children's Science Discourse within Software Design Activities","While educational research and practice have found many benefits of integrative, long-term, and complex design activities, an issue of growing concern is that students might lose sight of science learning while diverting their attention to design aesthetics, collaborative management, and technology. A question is whether or not science is actually separate from these aspects; it may be that science permeates the design environment and is thus contexted within these other activities. To investigate this possibility, we followed three student teams participating in a design project for 10 weeks as they met to collaboratively plan a science software simulation. Specifically, we examined their science discussions during planning and what conversational contexts gave rise to science talk. We found that these planning sessions provided a rich context for problematizing; however, the more students focused on the fine-grained details of the simulation itself, the more sophisticated their science talk was. Results also showed that experienced designers in each of the teams played a crucial role in shaping the contexts for science talk. We discuss the implications for how design tasks might be structured in the future to provide the most productive contexts for problematizing science content and facilitating fruitful science discourse.","Design","Long

Three problems that commonly arise in CSCL systems are addressed: How to achieve social orientation and group awareness, how to coordinate goal-directed interaction, and how to construct a shared knowledge base. With respect to each problem, we propose a guiding metaphor which links theoretical, technical, and usability requirements. If appropriately implemented, each metaphor resolves a problem: Virtual rooms support social orientation in small and medium sized groups, learning protocols guide interactions aimed at knowledge acquisition, and knowledge nets provide a means to represent socially shared knowledge. Theoretically, the metaphor of virtual rooms originates in work on virtual spaces in human computer interaction, learning protocols are related to speech act theory, and knowledge nets are based on cognitive models of knowledge representation. In concert, these concepts form a coherent design for learning environments. A prototype system implementing the virtual room metaphor is sketched, and further directions on how to integrate learning protocols and knowledge nets are outlined. We argue that by integrating these three metaphors a cognitively and educationally sound CSCL-environment can be achieved.","Computer Supported Collaborative Learning","Long

Only the best performing, and thus most promising ones, would then be tested on actual human subjects. In particular, the paper presents a new form of cooperative learning, called coactive learning. After arguing that humans could be taught to learn coactively, experiments are conducted with various coactive learning schemes. The results of the experiments demonstrate situations in which machine learning agents using coactive learning can perform better than individual machine learning agents. Collaborative learning through coaction is shown to generate properties that individual learners can achieve only through computationally intensive strategies, that are not always accessible to human learners. It is suggested that human learners be trained to learn coactively using the most successful agent coacting protocols, and compared, on the same type of learning task, to individual learners and groups of learners not trained in these protocols.","Computer Supported Collaborative Learning","Long

Recently, and with various degrees of success, the web is used as an information resource. Teachers evaluating the resulting artifacts experience difficulty in differentiating between students actual understanding of the topic area and prolific copying and pasting from the web approaches. In the context of a social studies class, we explored the idea of having students build interactive web-based simulations instead of posterboards as means to gain a deeper understanding of complex issues. To build a running simulation students cannot simply paste existing pieces together. Instead, this process actively engages students by forcing them to map one kind of representation onto another. At the same time, the notion of simulation is not a trivial one. Fully appreciating the value of simulations requires time and building one requires additional effort by the students. This paper reports on the use of the AgentSheets environment in having students with no programming experience build interactive simulations that they could share through the web as part of a non-technology centered social studies course on protest and reform.","Design and Use of Simulations","Long

However, it has proven very difficult to design educational software that is both sufficiently flexible to provide the kind of open-ended environment that will encourage learning, and sufficiently structured to be comprehensible and to allow the system to provide helpful coaching. We have confronted these challenges in the context of a reusable, subject-matter educational architecture, which we call Advise, for teaching through an analysis-and-recommendation task. This paper discusses our experience trying to improve several generations of Advise along dimensions of flexibility and structure, and offers suggestions to designers of other educational simulations. In particular, it examines a) how to structure complex tasks to provide a happy balance between structure and flexibility, b) how to communicate the task structure well enough to students that they know what they can and should do, and c) how to encourage student flexibility, so students don't fall into the common trap of following a particular task structure by rote, failing to make their own choices about how to use the environment.","Design and Use of Simulations","Long

We were particularly concerned with: (1) whether the use of the knowledge medium in self-explaining further improves students' conceptual understanding, and (2) what types of self-explaining activities learners engage in with the medium. Eight undergraduate students participated in the study. Four were allocated in a condition for self-explaining in a normal way. The other four were allocated in a condition for self-explaining with the knowledge medium. The students listened to three sessions of a psychology lecture on human memory, then engaged in self-explaining after each session. Their conceptual understanding was evaluated by post tests. Results showed: (1) that students with the knowledge medium manifested significantly higher conceptual understanding, and (2) that the students significantly more engaged in manipulation of different types of knowledge across different sessions. Thus, the study confirmed the effects of knowledge media on facilitation of students' conceptual understanding through self-explaining, and identified that knowledge media might have effects to make students manipulate their knowledge in a more constructive way.","Psychological Foundations","Long

In this study, a framework for discussing knowledge structures from a constructivist perspective is proposed. These hypothetical structures, called dynamic multidimensional schema, are based on characteristics of traditional schema, dynamic systems models, and the rhizome metaphor. Support for the definition of these structures was gathered through a preliminary qualitative study of first and sixth grade students. Identified in these children's structures were cues which prompted children to think beyond the domain, and trajectories which described the nature of the nondomain topics that the children's thoughts extended to. Seven cues and nine trajectory types were identified.","Psychological Foundations","Long Paper","knowledge,structure,typically,described,cognitive,theoretical,perspective,study,framework,discussing,knowledge,structure,constructivist,perspective,proposed,hypothetical,structure,called,dynamic,multidimensional,schema,based,characteristic,traditional,schema,dynamic,system,model,rhizome,metaphor,support,definition,structure,gathered,preliminary,qualitative,study,first,sixth,grade,student,identified,child,'s,structure,cue,prompted,child,think,beyond,domain,trajectory,described,nature,nondomain,topic,child,'s,thought,extended,seven,cue,nine,trajectory,type,identified","knowledge structure,structure typically,typically described,described cognitive,cognitive theoretical,theoretical perspective,perspective study,study framework,framework discussing,discussing knowledge,knowledge structure,structure constructivist,constructivist perspective,perspective proposed,proposed hypothetical,hypothetical structure,structure called,called dynamic,dynamic multidimensional,multidimensional schema,schema based,based characteristic,characteristic traditional,traditional schema,schema dynamic,dynamic system,system model,model rhizome,rhizome metaphor,metaphor support,support definition,definition structure,structure gathered,gathered preliminary,preliminary qualitative,qualitative study,study first,first sixth,sixth grade,grade student,student identified,identified child,child 's,'s structure,structure cue,cue prompted,prompted child,child think,think beyond,beyond domain,domain trajectory,trajectory described,described nature,nature nondomain,nondomain topic,topic child,child 's,'s thought,thought extended,extended seven,seven cue,cue nine,nine trajectory,trajectory type,type identified","knowledge structure typically,structure typically described,typically described cognitive,described cognitive theoretical,cognitive theoretical perspective,theoretical perspective study,perspective study framework,study framework discussing,framework discussing knowledge,discussing knowledge structure,knowledge structure constructivist,structure constructivist perspective,constructivist perspective proposed,perspective proposed hypothetical,proposed hypothetical structure,hypothetical structure called,structure called dynamic,called dynamic multidimensional,dynamic multidimensional schema,multidimensional schema based,schema based characteristic,based characteristic traditional,characteristic traditional schema,traditional schema dynamic,schema dynamic system,dynamic system model,system model rhizome,model rhizome metaphor,rhizome metaphor support,metaphor support definition,support definition structure,definition structure gathered,structure gathered preliminary,gathered preliminary qualitative,preliminary qualitative study,qualitative study first,study first sixth,first sixth grade,sixth grade student,grade student identified,student identified child,identified child 's,child 's structure,'s structure cue,structure cue prompted,cue prompted child,prompted child think,child think beyond,think beyond domain,beyond domain trajectory,domain trajectory described,trajectory described nature,described nature nondomain,nature nondomain topic,nondomain topic child,topic child 's,child 's thought,'s thought extended,thought extended seven,extended seven cue,seven cue nine,cue nine trajectory,nine trajectory type,trajectory type identified"

Case-based reasoning's cognitive model provided a conceptual framework for envisioning a classroom and curriculum where learning happens as a result of a series of design experiences, problem-based learning told us how to enact exemplary practices in the classroom, and case-based reasoning and its relatives (e.g., analogical reasoning, cognitive flexibility theory) provided specific guidelines for implementing practices. What was needed, we said, was experience in the classroom that we would use to debug the model we had set up. This paper presents Learning by Design (LBD), the approach to practice that we've developed over the past three years based on the guidelines put forth by CBR and PBL. We've learned many different pedagogical tools and practices for accomplishing LBD's goals. Our recent pilots also suggest several key values that must be bought into and practiced by teachers as a necessary condition for successful LBD implementation.","Learning by Design","Long

Our experiences with using the diaries in middle school classrooms have helped us understand that in the dynamic, complex environment of the classroom, not all of the scaffolding can be provided with any one tool. Scaffolding needs to be distributed across the various agents that play a role in learning (for example - the teacher, peers and software and paper and pencil tools).

Teacher and student teams seek solutions for current real world concerns through a collaborative, distance learning process. The teams enhance their use of computer technology by developing skills in web page development, concept mapping and Internet research. Participant efforts are consolidated via e-mail and a web-based curriculum. The teams interact with electronic mentors through the web site's question submission area and ongoing dialogue page. Student work is published on the CIF web page and the teams participate in a culminating multi-media activity. The CIF Program is based on a curriculum model that can be utilized for a variety of topic areas. The presentation will include a demonstration of a multidisciplinary curriculum model that integrates effective educational components (constructivism, Socratic dialogue, critical thinking, collaborative environments, standards and benchmarks), computer technology, assessment, and community building. Attendees and presenters discuss the successful application and evaluation of the model in education. Attendees leave with an understanding of the model, how to facilitate the acquisition of telecommunication skills needed to conduct electronic research, and how to incorporate their own topics into

22,22,"Hester, Peggy P.","Role of Families in Supporting & Expanding Child Learning by Using Anchored Instruction & Technology Supported Materials & Activities","Research conducted during the last 25 years has shown that parent involvement is important for children1s learning, attitudes about school, and their aspirations. Child academic achievement is further impacted by poverty and the educational level of the parents. Conversely, research suggests that by opening home-school communication lines and establishing learning communities that support child learning beyond the classroom, child learning can be enhanced. Based on surveys and interviews with teachers, administrator, and parents of children at- risk due to disadvantaged economic circumstances, our project identified several variables as important to parents for strengthening the home-school connection. Chief among them was the need for resources that they could use at home with specific instructions as to how to use them. This paper presents the results of two studies that demonstrated that by providing parents with technology supported materials and activities linked to anchor stories used in the classroom, the type and amont of parent-child interaction at home could be positively enhanced. The study highlighted the desire of parents to be involved in child learning and that anchored cost-effective materials and activities, along with specific instructions, can be an effective strategy to support child learning beyond the classroom.","Families and Homes","Long

This paper argues, in contrast, that computational media are capable of enhancing the expressiveness of more traditional materials, and enumerates three design principles for computationally-enriched educational handicrafts that take advantage of the valuable characteristics of both computation and craft materials. The resulting system should (1) make possible increased complexity of constructions beyond what a designer could achieve without computational support, (2) exploit the breadth of existing computational resources that, in a sense, come """"for free"""" with the addition of computational support, and (3) encourage the use of design formalisms as experimental artifacts, stimulating new design languages that in turn become the means through which novel, creative ideas are realized. We present two instances of this design strategy in operation. The first is HyperGami, a design tool for customized paper polyhedral models and polyhedral sculptures. The second is HyperSpider, a design tool for three-dimensional string sculptures. In each case, we follow the design process from initial conception through final construction.","Kids Building Stuff","Long

In many cases, teachers' understandings of science fair projects govern their understanding of project-based science. The paper briefly discusses the organizational context in which teachers' understandings are rooted. The analysis of differences between project-based science and science fair projects provides insights into ways in which researchers' and teachers' thinking about science instruction converge and diverge. It also reveals the issues of context that researchers face as they introduce theoretically-grounded learning environments into schools. This work emerged from a study of the newly established Center for Learning Technologies in Urban Schools, a partnership of Northwestern University, the Chicago Public Schools, the University of Michigan, and the Detroit Public Schools, and in particular five work cirlces composed of researchers, school principals, and teachers.

Taking an alternative approach, this study investigated children as the tool makers to support their own planning performance in a software design project, situated in a long-term science intervention. Teams of students from an upper elementary science class engaged in a ten week project to design an educational simulation for younger students. They created their own project planning artifacts, given a blank planning board and a set of open-ended tools. Study results report on the similarities and differences between teams in the functional organization of their planning space and the use of artifacts displayed on boards to support project planning. We also report on changes over time in the function and use of team-generated planning artifacts as planning functions shift between physical, virtual, and social spaces. We conclude with a discussion of considerations for future tool development and for classroom practice.","Kids Building Stuff","Long

Forty-six undergraduates completed a lesson designed to help them understand variance and its notation. Students in the invention group were asked to create a procedure for calculating the variance of contrasting distributions of numbers; students in the procedural group were presented with a procedure for calculating variance and asked to practice it on the numbers. Results indicate that invention students learned to reflect on the quantitative properties of distributions, and to evaluate statistical procedures in terms of their ability to differentiate those properties. Students in the procedural condition tended to evaluate a procedure simply in terms of whether or not it was like the """"correct"""" procedure. We plan to extend this instructional method to facilitate classroom conversations and as a platform for a complementary intelligent instructional system.","Learning About Math and

We focus on one environment, Architech@, which supports students as they design research stations in Antarctica and provides experiences with important mathematics such as the concepts of size, scale, and functions. We summarize a case study showing how a pair of students used Architech@ to develop a sense of what is a reasonable size for objects on their floor plan and a reasonable scale for their design. The case also shows the reciprocity between the activity structures in the classroom, the work in the student group, the questions from the teacher, and the technology.

Interactive analogies are pairs of simulations. In the attempt to answer specific problems, students interact with each simulation and map the analogous structures in each. Interactive analogies provide a complementary use of analogies and simulations; the weaknesses of one approach are handled by the strengths of the other. Analogies are useful in this regard because they allow students to draw on prior knowledge from a related domain. On the other hand, analogies do not provide feedback that helps students progressively map the structures between two domains. For example, simply telling someone that a battery is like an elevated water tank will not help most students work out the relevant similarities. Simulations provide useful feedback by allowing the student to test out possible relations. In the beginning of the paper we provide a quick overview of the strengths and weaknesses of simulations and analogies, and how interactive analogies may provide an excellent combination of the two. Afterwards, we describe an example of an interactive analogy we have developed for the domain of electrical circuits, and we describe some """"telling cases"""" as to its usefulness. Finally, we discuss work we are currently conducting and issues we hope to address in the future.","Learning About Math and Representations","Long

We present a framework for the construction of narrative which indicates some of the underlying constituent processes and their potential scaffolds and we discuss the use of Galapagos, a CD-ROM which teaches students about Darwin's theory of evolution. This was developed to test our hypotheses about how narrative in MILEs can provide guidance and scaffolding of the task and the learners. Students using Galapagos are set a task which requires them to collaborate in the construction of an answer in the notepad facility provided by the CD-ROM; these notepads offer one representation of the emerging narratives being constructed by each group.

31,31,"Luckin, Rosemary","Knowledge Construction in the Zone of Collaboration: Scaffolding the learner to productive interactivity","Computer software offers the possibility of a wealth of interactive learning experiences. These can be productive if this interactivity is grounded in a philosophy of education which fosters its potential. Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) provides such a philosophy, because it highlights the inseparability of the teaching and learning processes and emphasises the interactive nature of education. This paper describes the Ecolab software which explores the way the ZPD can be used in the design of an Interactive Learning Environment (ILE). It highlights the benefits of focusing upon the learner and ensuring her extension beyond her current ability level. The trilogy of system manipulations implemented in the Ecolab each approach control for the software scaffolding features which are available in a different way. VIS keeps control with the system and makes an explicit attempt to extend the learner. WIS gives more control to the user. It offers only suggestions about what she should try next, but allocates a level of help in line with her past achievements. NIS offers total control to the learner. An evaluation of the Ecolab has illustrated that the approach adopted by VIS promotes the construction of the most productive interactions with the majority of learners.","Scaffolding","Long

Students tend to focus on obtaining desired outcomes rather than on understanding causes and effects. Inquiry skills are increasingly important for students entering the health professions who may later conduct large-scale research such as clinical trials or be required to interpret the results of such research. To learn how to design and interpret the results of experiments, these students must have appropriate experiences and support to help shape the experience, model the inquiry process, and encourage reflection. Simulations offer promise for providing these experiences. One such simulation environment, the Oncology Thinking Cap (OncoTCap ) provides a comprehensive modeling workbench for cancer researchers. This tool is versatile and can be used to model clinical trials, but its functions and operation may impose excessive cognitive load for the novice. Also, novices may have little knowledge of the kinds of experimental designs used in cancer research. There are well-defined designs for clinical trials of new drugs, used at different stages of testing and for different purposes. As Baker and Dunbar (1996) note, the expert scientist often has a mental schema with slots to be filled with the items needed to determine an experimental design. Work on software-realized scaffolding suggests that communicating the design process is one way that learners can begin to construct these schemas. In this paper, we report on the design, use, and evaluation of a special purpose interface, the Phase II Trial Design wizard, to help scaffold medical students' design of an experiment to test a new cancer drug.","Scaffolding","Long

The development of a mathematical practice across two social contexts","In this paper we present a case study of how the students' understanding and use of the Sample Space--a central aspect of probability theory--develops across two social contexts of the Probability Inquiry Environment (PIE). PIE is a computer-mediated inquiry environment designed to help middle school students learn elementary probability theory through active investigations. First, we examine the local context consisting of pairs of students working together with the simulation. Second, we investigate how the public context of whole class discussions contributes to learning. We argue that the local context of the investigation provides the opportunity for students to experience and practice separating information from noise, whereas the public context of the whole class discussion provides a forum where the student's invented mathematics is brought to consensus with that of their classmates and the normative reasoning of the domain. The findings of this research illustrates the value of complementary social contexts for computer supported, inquiry-based learning environments.","Social Contexts in Learning","Long

34,34,"Karlgren, Klas||Ramberg, Robert","Learning the Refined Language Game of Polarization of Light in Physics","Abstract: Many students seem to approach the field of electromagnetic wave theory with everyday conceptions of central concepts such as polarization. A study on university students' understanding of the concept of polarization is presented indicating that the students have trouble with the concept because their everyday use of the term conflicts with a scientific use of the term. Most students are able to make correct predictions about polarization in familiar situations but many have trouble giving explanations of these. In certain less familiar cases the subjects give incorrect predictions but explanations that happen to correspond to the scientific ones because they seem to be unaware of the role of reflection of light for polarization. The results also imply that the subjects give more correct predictions and explanations if they are initially asked to explain polarization phenomena, and not only predict such phenomena. Moreover, in some cases some of the students showed that they had learned the scientific explanation but also showed some hesitation as to what this meant for their subjective experiences, i.e., they were unable to make predictions about their visual experiences from the explanation illustrating a gap between the scientific language game and everyday situations","Social Contexts in Learning","Long

35,35,"Bers, Marina Umaschi","A constructionist approach to values through on-line narrative tools","We live in a society where concepts of self, family, community and """"what is right and wrong"""" are constantly changing. Therefore there is a need for learning environments that encourage children to actively explore their identity as well as the personal and social values they live by. Computational tools have great potential to foster learning about these issues. However, there has been little research in this area. The few technological environments that exist address values as a decision-making problem and are theoretically grounded on what I call the moral reasoning approach. In this paper I propose the narrative approach, which is based on a constructionist way of learning about the connection between identity and values. The research looks at how on-line collaborative environments can become tools to think about moral and identity issues. The paper also describes an on-going research project, Kaleidostories, which looks at computer-based narrative tools to support construction of coherence between the fragmented selves and values that populate our identity. The goal is to explore how new technologies can assist in children's discovery of their own selves as well as the underlying patterns of thought and behavior that connect the worldviews proposed by different religions and cultures.","Social Contexts in Learning","Long

In the first condition, subjects were given a patient case and asked to verbalize their reasoning about the problem during a think-aloud protocol (TAP) session. The second group of subjects used the computer program Convince Me (CM) to reason about the case. Subjects in both groups successfully solved the case problem and recognized irrelevant evidence as such. Although it took considerably longer for CM subjects to complete the assignment, their arguments seem more sophisticated, exhibiting trends toward (1) more alternative hypotheses for the solution, (2) more new, auxiliary, evidence to support their hypotheses, (3) more contradictory evidence and contradictory relationships, and (4) more relationships (links) per proposition (node). The Model's Fit feature of Convince Me further indicated their arguments to be reasonably coherent. TAP subjects, on the other hand, cited more total evidence in their arguments, were more likely to draw a diagram to reason about the case, and rated their method more highly than did CM subjects. We discuss these findings in the context of (a) past results, (b) issues of usability and (c) improving the match between methodology and instructional milieu.","Professional Learning","Long

43,43,"Stahl, Gerry","Learning Perspectives","Learning as a socially situated activity involves an interplay between group and personal perspectives. Knowledge is constructed within nested perspectives that reflect social practices, shared meanings, and individual understandings. Educational software to support collaborative learning can represent these perspectives for learners to help them reflect on their own perspectives and negotiate group perspectives on knowledge. By providing different views on a shared and growing knowledge base, perspective-based software distinguishes different peopleÃ­s ideas to make clear each personÃ­s perspective on common topics. Individuals work on their own ideas, share them, and propose them for group adoption. The convergence needed for successful collaborative learning emerges from a process of negotiation in which divergent positions are distinguished and discussed. Students using the software have a representation for thinking about learning perspectives, a mechanism for organizing their own perspectives in relation to those of their classmates, and a tool for mediating formative involvements in collaboration, research, and negotiation. Ã¬Learning PerspectivesÃ® proposes perspectives on learning as a social, linguistic, and perspectival process. It introduces a software mechanism for representing and organizing group and personal knowledge to scaffold learnersÃ­ learning about perspectives. Then it illustrates the use of perspectives for learning in project-based classrooms.","","Poster","learning,socially,situated,activity,involves,interplay,group,personal,perspective,knowledge,constructed,within,nested,perspective,reflect,social,practice,shared,meaning,individual,understanding,educational,software,support,collaborative,learning,represent,perspective,learner,help,reflect,perspective,negotiate,group,perspective,knowledge,providing,different,view,shared,growing,knowledge,base,perspective-based,software,distinguishes,different,peopleÃ­s,idea,make,clear,personÃ­s,perspective,common,topic,individual,work,idea,share,propose,group,adoption,convergence,needed,successful,collaborative,learning,emerges,process,negotiation,divergent,position,distinguished,discussed,student,using,software,representation,thinking,learning,perspective,mechanism,organizing,perspective,relation,classmate,tool,mediating,formative,involvement,collaboration,research,negotiation,Ã¬learning,perspectivesÃ®,proposes,perspective,learning,social,linguistic,perspectival,process,introduces,software,mechanism,representing,organizing,group,personal,knowledge,scaffold,learnersÃ­,learning,perspective,illustrates,use,perspective,learning,project-based,classroom","learning

This raises questions regarding the impact of collaboration within the virtual environment on overall learning processes. A preliminary study of 18 sixth graders was conducted for the purpose of examining peer collaboration within a virtual environment (VE). Students worked in pairs while investigating the concept of global warming within a fully immersive, 3-D, virtual reality based model of Seattle called Global Change World (GCW). It is concluded that the students thoroughly enjoyed their experience with GCW. It was apparent that peer collaboration played a significant role in regards to the level of student engagement within the VE. The ability of the students to communicate with each other via an intercom assisted dyads in effective navigation through the virtual world and performance of requested tasks. This preliminary study found that, while the potential for GCW to facilitate collaborative learning experiences appears to be great, further research is needed that will focus more closely on the impact of peer collaboration on preconceived or """"naive"""" scientific concepts as well as the possible conceptual change inspired by collaboration within

Although it was originally designed simply to support the efficient collection, review, and coordination of proposals to present original research at this organizationÃ­s annual meeting, the system and its Web format eventually turned out to have implications for the broader practices and protocols of the organization. This study represents one part of an ongoing investigation of the significance of this Web-based system in the life of the organization. It is our hope that by considering the implications of this particular Web innovation, we can begin to draw more general conclusions about the influence of Web technology on activity within the structure of social organizations. The focal questions of this project are: How does the introduction of this Web-based system into existing, non-computerized practices violate the expectations and assumptions of organization members? What are the implications of this violation for membersÃ­ perceptions of the goals of the organization and their role within it?","","Poster","summer,1997,researcher,large,midwestern,university,facilitated,pilot,test,web-based,document,management,system,large,educational,research,organization,although,originally,designed,simply,support,efficient,collection,review,coordination,proposal,present,original,research,organizationÃ­s,annual,meeting,system,web,format,eventually,turned,implication,broader,practice,protocol,organization,study,represents,one,part,ongoing,investigation,significance,web-based,system,life,organization,hope,considering,implication,particular,web,innovation,begin,draw,general,conclusion,influence,web,technology,activity,within,structure,social,organization,focal,question,project,introduction,web-based,system,existing,non-computerized,practice,violate,expectation,assumption,organization,member,implication,violation,membersÃ­,perception,goal,organization,role,within","summer

Research reveals that these problems are intimately linked to the extraordinary cognitive demands of producing effective writing. Existing books and on-line resources for teaching scientific writing generally do not address these process-based demands; instead, these resources focus on grammatical and stylistic rules for writing as well as the format of final products. In contrast, Science WRITE's curriculum, which is based on cognitive research, supports students in carrying out the mental operations that expert writers employ. Accordingly, we are developing Science WRITE to help students acquire discourse and procedural knowledge through working with modules that reflect cognitive subprocesses in writing. The modules include models of expert processes and products, tools to support students in executing and monitoring expert processes, and tools for social knowledge building and peer review. Our purposes for this presentation are to introduce the components of Science WRITE, relate its learning activities and tools to cognitive research on writing processes in novices and experts, present our goals for student learning, and provide an overview of plans for our research

Critically, these are not inherent features of the representations themselves but are the products of how individuals or groups interpret them. Following how students learn to interpret mathematical representations contributes to an understanding of the discursive practices involved in producing mathematical claims and how these practices develop in the context of math classrooms. In this paper, I present two cases where middle school students in different classrooms interpret the same graph for an audience of their classmates. In each case, the students construct narratives which propose different ways of understanding what is represented by the graph. Through close examination of the ways that the students construct their narratives, I show how they propose particular kinds of listeners. Using their proposed audience and the intended purpose of the presentation as a resource, I argue, directly affects the scope of the claims made about the graphs. In the first case, I show the construction of a 3general2 reading of a graph, and in the second, a 3specific2 interpretation of the same graph.","","Poster","mathematical,representation,commonly,used,make,claim,situation,show,way,thing,defend,certain,position,action,critically,inherent,feature,representation,product,individual,group,interpret,following,student,learn,interpret,mathematical,representation,contributes,understanding,discursive,practice,involved,producing,mathematical,claim,practice,develop,context,math,classroom,paper,present,two,case,middle,school,student,different,classroom,interpret,graph,audience,classmate,case,student,construct,narrative,propose,different,way,understanding,represented,graph,close,examination,way,student,construct,narrative,show,propose,particular,kind,listener,using,proposed,audience,intended,purpose,presentation,resource,argue,directly,affect,scope,claim,made,graph,first,case,show,construction,3general2,reading,graph,second,3specific2,interpretation,graph","mathematical

However, most implementations of case-based pedagogy for teachers rely on traditional media and means. We have been developing and assessing the utility of hypermedia-based tools for case-based learning. Briefly, our evolving design principles in case design call for the case to be authentic and narrative in form. The case should be long enough to establish some form of instructional corridor. The cases also should have additional supporting video to provide multiple examples (telescoping) and should help teachers come to view themselves as active agents in their studentsÃ­ learning. Along the way, we have confronted a number of design challenges, including consideration of the very nature of a case and appropriate means for anchoring case-activity to important mathematical ideas. Accordingly, we describe an evolving set of design principles for case-based instruction with hypermedia and report some of the ways in which we assess learning with these tools.

Over 4,000 students and 60 scientists who participated in the Kids as Global Scientists, an Internet-enhanced atmospheric science program, exchanged the total of 4,464 messages during eight week period. In order to identify the unique characteristics of electronic discourse in K-12 educational settings and how the electronic discourse is similar to or different from the traditional classroom discourse, patterns of discourse and content of messages were analyzed. Compared to a teacher-dominant traditional classroom conversation, more student-student communications were encouraged on the Message Board. Developing social glue among participants and building identity as members of the electronic community of science learners were key factors in making electronic discourse more productive. From the beginning, participants shared their common goals, studying weather phenomena around them, by talking to each other and introducing their weather and surroundings as well as themselves. The awareness of a sense of community encouraged them to work together and share each other's experiences as valuable resources for developing understanding. We also found that a well-coordinated curriculum could support building the active electronic community of science learners.","","Poster","study,examined,characteristic,pattern,electronic,discourse,web-based,discussion,tool,called,message,board,4,000,student,60,scientist,participated,kid,global,scientist,internet-enhanced,atmospheric,science,program,exchanged,total,4,464,message,eight,week,period,order,identify,unique,characteristic,electronic,discourse,k-12,educational,setting,electronic,discourse,similar,different,traditional,classroom,discourse,pattern,discourse,content,message,analyzed,compared,teacher-dominant,traditional,classroom,conversation,student-student,communication,encouraged,message,board,developing,social,glue,among,participant,building,identity,member,electronic,community,science,learner,key,factor,making,electronic,discourse,productive,beginning,participant,shared,common,goal,studying,weather,phenomenon,around,talking,introducing,weather,surroundings,well,awareness,sense,community,encouraged,work,together,share,'s,experience,valuable,resource,developing,understanding,also,found,well-coordinated,curriculum,could,support,building,active,electronic,community,science,learner","study

OPDM is designed as an on-line forum where practicing teachers can learn from each other and from mentors as they engage in sustained reflection and discussion about actual practice OPDM is designed as a netcourse, i.e., a seminar or course of study using the Internet as the primary way to distribute materials, make assignments, collect student work, and carry out discussions. The course is anchored in the study of classroom artifacts including actual samples of middle school student writing and writing samples from participantsÃ­ own students. Participants studied these artifacts in order to understand what they revealed about teaching and learning. Initial evaluation of the first conduct of the OPDM netcourse revealed that participants were eventually able to overcome numerous barriers to participation created by unfamiliar technology. Barriers created by a lack of community were more difficult to surmount. Teachers found themselves involved in a discussion with strangers who were experts in their profession. As a result, they were often unwilling to have the kinds of frank discussions necessary for changing deeply held

Motivational researchers interested in education have tended to focus on providing advice to teachers and instructional designers working in traditional classroom settings. Learning environment designers interested in motivation have tended to focus on activity design, describingmotivation in general terms, rather than using the constructs developed in the motivation literature. I have developed the Ã¬Passion curriculumÃ® design approach, a framework for learning environment design based on four design principles that bridge between the motivational literature and the progressive education literature. During 1997 and 1998, I built and implemented a prototype passion curriculum, the Video Crew.

The software provides an arena for students to explore and analyze Hall of Fame artifacts, develop findings, and synthesize these findings into a coherent, shareable and interactive presentation. Instead of passively receiving discrete, disconnected, and pre-digested facts from a static source like a textbook, students using Abner actively select, interpret, and modify factual information from a dynamic database, building an exhibit reflecting their understanding of a part of a larger historical or cultural domain.
