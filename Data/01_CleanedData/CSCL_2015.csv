It has been suggested that novice music learners should start with what they know how to intuitively do already, which will allow them to move to more sophisticated musical concepts (e.g., notation, intervals).  However, music production is becoming more a group project than a solitary one in which everyone in a group has a voice.  A fourth grade classroom (N = 36) engaged in a music curriculum using the learning software Impromptu.  Findings suggest that when students are able to reflect-in-action, their reflections become building blocks for others in the group to use and add to their knowledge base.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:11Z (GMT).

CK facilitated the scaffolding of grade 5/6 students through phases of collaborative biodiversity (CK2) and astronomy (CK3) inquiry. Using tablets, students contributed to a community knowledge base that was publicly displayed on an interactive whiteboard (IWB). The IWB visualized the community’s idea flow, enabling learners to sort their ideas along socially-negotiated categories. Inquiry work done in the CK environment affected the knowledge work done in the face-to-face classroom discussions, and vice versa. We observed that teachers used an orchestration cycle of Reflect-Refocus-Release (3R) as a means of managing this blended learning environment. A comparison of teachers’ Reflect discourse structures between both iterations, indicate such patterns vary with inquiry task demands.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:12Z (GMT).

Students found Connected Biology useful (learnable, memorable, satisfying, and error-free) but not efficient. Although they accessed Connected Biology over 15 weeks, they tended to use it primarily to get feedback on their understanding of course content and not for exploratory activities. Interviews with faculty teaching introductory science courses indicated that most hold to a prescriptive learning model.

We proposed the combination of social network analysis (SNA) and in-depth dialogical analysis as a multivocality approach and analyzed discourse transcriptions of collaborative reading comprehension by university students as datasets. First, we identified pivotal points of discourse where students might engage in an epistemic action toward alleviating a lack of knowledge. Then, we conducted in-depth analysis of discourse segments around the pivotal points. Results revealed that pivotal points identified by SNA were confirmed as alleviating lack of knowledge by further in-depth dialogical analysis. We further succeeded in identifying dialogical patterns in the shared epistemic agency and each individual student’s contribution to them.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:14Z (GMT).

In this paper, we present, analyse and discuss how two nine-year-old children collaborate through gesturing and moving their bodies around a touchscreen. The pair is working with the concept of scale and are in midst of copying their rooms from paper to touchscreen. During this process, the pair engages in a discussion regarding the size of one meter through language, gestures and manipulation of the material resource. The analysis shows two distinct ways of understanding the length of one meter, which primarily is visible through the children’s gesturing and bodily movement. In conclusion, the analysis shows that children dynamically produce body-material resources for communicative and illustrative purposes; moreover, they use body-material as a cognitive tool and as a way of shepherding the other.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:15Z (GMT).

The focal point is their teacher's intervention, in which she attempts to get her students out of a messy situation. This analysis helps to understand, in fine grain, the process – and consequences – of avoiding refutation of non-productive narratives, before adding new ones - in the context of math problem solving. In addition, we learn that in the process of solution, narratives might not always compete: ideas from two, or more, narratives could be forged to new Situational misconceptions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:15Z (GMT).

We propose a computational model using ReaderBench that assesses collaboration from a dialogical perspective. Accordingly, collaboration emerges from the inter-twining of different points of view or, more specifically, from the inter-animation of voices pertaining to different speakers. Collaboration is determined from the intertwining or overlap of voices emitted by different participants throughout the ongoing conversation. This study presents a validation of this model consisting of a comparison between the output of our system and human evaluations of 10 chat conversations, selected from a corpus of more than 100 chats, in which Computer Science students debated on the advantages and disadvantages of CSCL technologies (e.g., chat, blog, wiki, forum, or Google Wave). The human evaluations of the degree of collaboration between the participants and the automated scores showed good overlap as measured by precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our overarching conclusion is that dialogism derived from the overlapping of voices can be perceived as a signature for collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:16Z (GMT).

Furthermore, despite the fact that several studies describe important roles for teachers in constructing successful classroom learning experiences, only a few of them examine how teachers’ instructional practices, knowledge, and beliefs influence student learning outcomes and the extent to which teachers are interested and willing to teach through complex systems approaches. Furthermore, we do not know what supports teachers themselves say that they need to teach about complex systems in their classrooms. In this study, we present a curriculum and instruction framework that outlines how teaching and learning about complex systems in high school science classroom contexts can be done. We articulate the features of the framework and provide examples of how the framework is translated into practice. We follow with evidence from an exploratory study conducted with 10 teachers and over 300 students aimed at understanding change in teachers’ instructional practices; the extent to which students learned from the activities; what teachers’ perceptions were in terms of utility and usability; and what other supports teachers needed.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:17Z (GMT).

This 2×2 field study (N=105) examines how Facebook can be harnessed for argumentative learning through group awareness tools and argumentation scripts. We measure domain-specific knowledge outcomes, the process of argumentative knowledge construction and attitude change. The results show a main effect for both conditions on domain-specific knowledge and argumentative knowledge construction, but no difference to the control group on attitude change. The epistemic quality and formal quality increased for the groups with argumentation script.

An ethnographic action research approach is used to analyze three sources of data: VMT user manuals; screenshots of tool interfaces and assignments; and logs of student chat sessions addressing those assignments. The analysis focuses on how the topic of ‘construction’ is articulated in each data set. The results show that the team understands ‘construction’ in terms of a complex web of knowledge of dynamic geometry, while the students develop their own emergent notions of ‘constructing’ from the boundary objects produced by the team. Recommendations for boundary object design are briefly considered.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:19Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We carried out an experiment (N=40) with a 2x2 design: the first factor compared traditional instruction (“Tell & Practice”) with a constructivist activity (using the Preparation for Future learning framework; PFL). The second factor contrasted state-of-the-art PFL learning activity (i.e., students studying Contrasting Cases) with an interactive tabletop featuring digitally-enhanced manipulatives. In agreement with prior work, we found that students who followed the PFL activity achieved significantly higher learning gains compared to their peers who followed a traditional “Tell & Practice” instruction (large effect size). Additionally, a similar effect was found in favor of the interactive tabletop compared to the Contrasting Cases (small to moderate effect size). Finally, we looked at four predictors to explain those results (students’ endurability, involvement, their curiosity, and the quality of their mental models). We found those variables to predict more than half of the variance (R2 = .58) of students’ learning gains. We discuss implications for designing constructivist activities using new computer interfaces.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:20Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

They moreover offer contexts for developing inquiry and literacy skills, as they position students as writers, and not just reviewers of science. Access to peers’ ideas can diversify students’ thinking, but also reinforce existing understanding. We investigate the real and perceived impacts of different prompts for students’ use of peers’ ideas. 144 middle school students used an online tool to exchange ideas during a science inquiry unit. Students prompted to seek ideas different from their own perceived their peers as having greater impact on their thinking than students prompted to seek ideas that reinforced their own. Although students’ revisions after exchanging ideas showed no actual change, students who diversified their ideas later showed significantly greater pre to post test gains.

Participants (N=54) worked in groups of two and solved optimization problems on the TinkerTable, a TUI designed for students in logistics. The TinkerTable features tangible shelves that students can manipulate to build and optimize the layout of a warehouse while the system provides feedback with a projector above the table. Using mobile eye-trackers, we examined participants’ visual coordination when solving those problems. We describe two contributions to the CSCL community: first, we propose a methodology for synchronizing two eye-tracking goggles and computing measures of joint visual attention (JVA) in a co-located setting. Second, we report preliminary findings suggesting that participants were more likely to have moments of joint attention when looking at 3D, realistic objects compared to 2D, abstract ones. JVA was also found to be a significant predictor of students’ learning gains and performance during the optimization tasks. We discuss implications of these findings for supporting interactions around a TUI.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The results show that members of class A had more comprehensive and coherent awareness of the various inquiry themes discussed by their community focusing on deep conceptualization of electricity.

It reports a study located in a novel multi-surface environment, configured to support small teams who are designing for other people’s learning. Despite growing awareness in the CSCL community of the importance of design in teachers’ work, there has been very little empirical research on how such design is carried out, or how design for CSCL can be supported and improved through the provision of better design tools and design methods. The paper offers an analysis of the work of four pairs of designers in our Multi-Surface Design Studio. These four dyads were completing a design task we set them, while simultaneously learning how to make good use of the various personal and shared digital tools, display surfaces and other resources in the studio. From observational and interview data, we show how collaborative design for learning needs to be understood as a complex, multiply-situated activity, in which design problem-solving, tools and space usage depend on the fluent deployment of intuitive knowledge about mutual awareness, shared perception, information persistence and movement.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:23Z (GMT).

The 57 studies that satisfied our search criteria were coded using a framework that considered the nature of the assessment intervention, the purposes of the assessment intervention, and the role of technology in student learning. This allowed us to identify four types of assessment interventions. The findings indicated that only interventions in the immersion orientation seemed to help students learn how to learn. Such assessment practices enabled students to learn actively and to learn both disciplinary substance and metacognitive/regulative skills. However, relatively few studies clearly integrated assessment and learning. The main contributions of this study are the coding framework and the four patterns of assessment interventions. Together, they provide a new way of thinking about the design of practice. The review provides guidance for the shift of assessment practice to scaffold learning of this field.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:23Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The study tested the effects of time, engagement, and self-perceived leadership on peer-nominated leadership. Results indicated that emergent leadership perceived by peers in a group not only required individuals’ active engagement and self-perception of their leadership role, but also required the leadership to be developed over time. High levels of perceived task leadership and active engagement would lead to more likelihood for individuals to be perceived by peers as emergent leaders in a group. Qualitative analysis revealed that quality of posts, active facilitation, quantity and diversity of posts, significant contribution, initiation of interaction, and motivating promotion were primary characteristics of emergent leaders.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:24Z (GMT).

The analysis describes the significant participant structures in the engineering co-op program and the pedagogical techniques that are used in these participant structures. The analysis suggests that participant structures and pedagogical techniques are both orchestrated by and orchestrate the development of one of the central epistemological features of collaborative engineering design. These results suggest that epistemographic analysis is a useful tool in the development and analysis of professional CSCL environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:25Z (GMT).

However, the orchestration load that such facilitation represents for the teacher, within the constraints of an authentic classroom, remains under-researched. This paper presents a novel method to estimate the cognitive load of teachers during facilitation of CSCL sessions, using mobile eye-tracking techniques. Throughout three studies of increasing authenticity, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, and extract insights about classroom usability challenges in CSCL practice: the increased load of class-level facilitation, or the real-time monitoring of students’ progress. This new instrument in the CSCL researcher’s toolkit can help focus our attention in critical, fine-grained classroom usability episodes, to make more informed design decisions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:25Z (GMT).

Studies that compare mixed courses to face-to-face or online courses have conflicting results: some find improved learning outcomes and some find no significant differences. We contend that these conflicting results are due to inconsistent or vague definitions of hybrid, blended, and flipped. To address this problem, we use the definitions from a recently proposed taxonomy to reclassify studies in the literature.  After reclassification, analysis of this literature reveals two main themes that illuminate how mixed instructional methods affect learning outcomes. Courses that use mixed methods can either reduce time in class and maintain learning outcomes or maintain time in class and improve learning outcomes.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:26Z (GMT).

Half of the pairs were assigned particular roles with associated game controls (positive interdependence condition) while the other half were not (control condition). Results showed that pairs in the assigned roles/controls condition gave more in-depth explanations to their partners about what they wanted to do in the game, but did not negotiate with each other more frequently than control pairs. They also had fewer but longer instances of jointly resolved conflict. Contrary to some previous findings, all pairs in both conditions were found to work together (rather than in parallel / competitively) the entire time. The general finding is a somewhat limited, but consistent, positive effect of the assigned roles/tools manipulation on collaborative processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:27Z (GMT).

The purpose of this study was to find out how they reflected collaboratively in the online learning environment and what they learned from the collaborative reflection process. Results show that they could reflect on the lesson content and link it to their teaching practice. Also, their peers could get additional perspectives, negotiate meaning, and learn how to reflect better from the reflection shared. Furthermore, they could also gain additional knowledge and emotional support from their peers’ comments.

This study identifies the variation in engagement and learning outcomes when two groups of students use two different digital learning resources for algebra: a game and a web-based resource. Further, the study explores how the digital learning resources create different conditions for social interaction and learning among students and their teacher in a classroom. The setting includes a class of 75 students (age 13–14) in two groups who receive identical instruction from their teacher. Field observations and pretests and posttests show that students playing the game are more engaged, yet their performance on posttests are significantly worse than the other group. Episodes of interaction between participants and technology suggest that they struggle with the symbolic world of the digital game, which constrains the mathematical meaning making that is relevant in schools.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:28Z (GMT).

We investigate the collaborative meaning-making and interaction process of two groups of 13-year-old students (Grade 7) during an outdoor mobile learning trail exploring the history and geographical features of World War II battle site. Methodologically, we employ video-based interaction analysis, which facilitates a micro-level analysis of human interaction, to understand how learners deploy and assemble the material and social resources available in the outdoor learning context. We surface two noteworthy patterns about a) how learners in small groups leverage semiotic resources to negotiate, repair and converge at shared meaning in changing contextual configurations and b) how prior learning experiences affect the way learners employ semiotic resources. The findings provide helpful insights into the design and implementation of mobile learning activities in outdoor settings.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:29Z (GMT).

Based on social cognitive theory, this study proposes two dynamic CSCL models of learning using understudied factors – system functionality, social ability, collective efficacy and social interaction – to examine mediation and causal relationships among these constructs and their influence on learning. The models are tested using data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed via the Partial Least Squares method. Results demonstrate close relatedness among the constructs and a different influencing mechanism on learning for each. The addition of social interaction as a factor to the learning model increases predictability of student learning as compared to models without this factor. The paper concludes with discussion of the implications of this study.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:30Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, there is no consensus on the actual roles these artifacts are playing in processes of (collaborative) knowledge creation. In this paper we argue that the prevailing theoretical accounts block sight for important epistemic processes and also hinder a deeper understanding of the material qualities of use as they focus on the explication of what is known rather than on what is not known yet. Drawing on an ethnographic study in a design studio course on industrial design, we depict the use of design artifacts in a set of epistemic patterns. Based on the conclusion that these artifacts can be understood as objects used to come to terms with the unknown, we discuss potential implications for CSCL systems aimed to foster collaborative knowledge creation.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:31Z (GMT).

We report on the iterative design process that has shaped this web-based asynchronous learning environment and on its use as part of an active learning pedagogy. Using mixed methods we have tested DALITE’s effectiveness to support conceptual change, examined the content of its databases, observed its use in classrooms, and conducted interviews from users – students as well as instructors. These data help to reveal the conditions of DALITE’s effectiveness. We discuss our findings and provide design guidelines.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:31Z (GMT).

In this study, we shed light on how we can initiate the process of connected learning through technology-realized and facilitator-based scaffolding of learners’ interests, social interactions, and scientific inquiry pursuits. Specifically, we documented three cases of learners in an afterschool program called Kitchen Chemistry and their use of a social media app called ScienceKit. Analysis of ScienceKit data with facilitator interactions reveals a typology of learner paths across connected learning experiences. Furthermore, understanding typologies that best match each learner appears to be critical for helping learners to make connections across interest-driven and peer-supported scientific inquiry.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:32Z (GMT).

Little is known about how students in symmetrical groups support one another to learn. We examined scaffolding interactions of two symmetrical groups of students as they worked on physics simulations over time. We analyzed the interactions within each group to understand how students support their peers to learn science. We found that students in Group A had a significantly greater proportion of scaffolding discourse than students in Group B, but there were no significant differences in students’ learning gains between the two groups. However, we found that one student in each group emerged as a more dominant scaffolder by driving the discourse and helping the group move forward with the task; this student made the most learning gains in each group.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:34Z (GMT).

Based on emerging research from the more than 4000 young people that have participated in FUSE in 30+ schools, libraries, and summer camps in the Chicago area, we have begun to characterize how the affordances of the FUSE website are supporting a shift in the material organization of learning in the in-school classrooms in which it is implemented. We describe how FUSE ‘re-mediates’ learning by providing individualized learning pathways, dynamic arrangements for learning, alternative forms of ‘assessment’, new roles for the teacher, and a rethinking of how curriculum materials are produced.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:35Z (GMT).

For this purpose, we built EarExplorer, an interactive tangible system where students can manipulate and connect parts of the auditory system to rebuild a functional structure. An augmented reality layer displays sound waves and shows how they are transformed at various stages of the process. Our previous work suggests that TUIs are particularly good at preparing students for future learning; that is, students learn more when they can explore a novel domain with a TUI before compared to after receiving a traditional (e.g. lecture or text based) instruction. In this study, we isolated the impact of structured guidance versus no guidance during a hands-on TUI activity on learning. In one condition, students rebuilt the hearing system by self-driven discovery; in another condition they rebuilt it by following the step-by-step instructions of a video-teacher. We found that the first group (“discover”) significantly outperformed the second group (“listen”) by ~27% on the final learning test. To explain those results, we analyzed the TUI logs and explored how this effect unfolded with participants of different ability (i.e., low versus high GPA students).","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:36Z (GMT).

In taking action as the unit of analysis, persons, speech acts, and artifacts are considered as the nodes in a functional model of learning. This method is illustrated by a simple proxy where a graduate student takes the place of a pilot apprentice who learns how to land an airplane in a computer simulation. Findings show that the SAN’s sociographs and the learning trajectory plot display the interconnected complexity of the learning that occurred at various forms of action as a result of participation. Further work and limitations of this method are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, roles may spontaneously emerge and result in distributed participation during collaboration, especially when students share and manage a single technology resource. We investigated how group discourse shaped emergent roles in a collaborative small group over the course of a 12-week science curriculum with simulated science experiments. Group members showed patterns in their discourse contributions in terms of content, function, and initiation and uptake of discourse topics. The emergence of these patterns stimulated role differentiation and stabilization. Conceptual discussion appeared to improve learning gains, while prioritization of task management detracted from learning. By tracking group discourse patterns, we can observe the process of role emergence in face-to-face CSCL interactions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Second, we will introduce simple tools that were used at different points of the collaborative task to increase teacher and student awareness of situation-specific regulation.  Third, we will provide case examples to illustrate how the collaborating groups with varying profiles benefit from use of the tool in practice. The results show that highly self-regulating collaborating groups saw the added value of the tool designed to support SSRL. However, the collaborating groups with low levels of self-regulation felt that it was merely an additional tool which needed to '“perform”.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:39Z (GMT).

Yet, inexperienced writers revise their texts too superficially. Peer-feedback has become a popular method to provide elaborate and timely feedback to students during writing. Though peer-feedback has  shown promising results, studies also indicate that students have problems benefitting from feedback, resulting in a lack of feedback uptake and little revision. Students might need to be facilitated to make sense of feedback and reflect more deeply on it. The study investigated the effect of sense-making support on revision skills and feedback uptake. Altogether, 73 university students were assigned to a condition either with or without sense-making support. Results showed no effect on revision skills, yet results of content-analysis yielded a significant effect for two out of three feedback uptake variables. Students in the condition with sense-making support made less new errors and rejected more incorrect feedback. Sense-making support appeared to help students to some extent to maximize benefit from peer-feedback.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:40Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Thirty-seven online students, belonging to one of 13 teams, formed the participants of the study. Teams completed five discussion sessions as part of required course activity, using one of two reflective conditions. Each team also received feedback on their performance. We assessed the quality of processes between groups using content analysis techniques. Team process measures at the first time point were used to identify groups’ initial strengths and weaknesses. To assess the utility of the model and reflective assessment designs, we used a 2x5 mixed factorial design, with Condition (two levels) as a between subjects factor and Time (5 levels) as a within subjects factor. We found that students were weakest at presenting and discussing claims and both Condition and Time are significant predictors of collaborative process quality.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:41Z (GMT).

Analysis of lexical proficiency based on Lexical Frequency Profile and P_Lex indicated significant growth in productive written vocabulary, especially for words beyond the first two 1,000 word lists. By tracing the growth of vocabulary extracted from specific word lists, we found that the growth rate for different types of words varied across each year but correlated with each other. Correlation analyses between these lexical measures and Knowledge Building behavioral indicators revealed that note revisions are the strongest predictor of vocabulary growth rate, whereas note reading is related with lexical proficiency measures.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:43Z (GMT).

Furthermore, game-based competencies and identities have been shown to be important for digitally-mediated learning activities and trajectories in computer science and technology. In this paper we look at how supportive communities can improve resilience by mitigating stereotype threat, and thereby helping to protect vulnerable groups from the negative effects of implicit and explicit bias in gaming culture and game-based learning activities. Our findings demonstrate that a female-supportive gaming community can foster equitable gaming identification and self-concept, and we propose that similar models can be used with other marginalized groups (i.e., ethnic/racial minorities).","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:43Z (GMT).

We compare across three communication media provided to students in that context in terms of relative popularity and overlap in student sub-populations. We also compare the communication between these contexts in terms of their content focus, concentration of reasoning articulation, and the interaction between the two.  This comparison allows investigating the specific contribution of synchronous collaboration in a MOOC, which is relatively novel.  The analysis suggests that there is value in providing a diverse set of discussion contexts in that they may lend themselves to differently natured interactions, but that it creates a need for greater efforts towards effective bridging between media and channeling of students to pockets of interaction that are potentially of personal benefit.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:44Z (GMT).

This paper demonstrates the use of some of the existing learning analytics techniques to develop practical strategies and interfaces for helping instructors to effectively monitor the collaborative knowledge building processes taking place at micro and macro levels. In particular, we demonstrate the use of topic segmentation, tag clouds and concordance analysis for the identification of excerpts where key concepts are discussed by the students.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:45Z (GMT).

Two classes of fifth graders in Hong Kong participated in a unit of electricity study. The design involves students engaging in scientific inquiry, pursuing ideas on Knowledge Forum®, and making epistemic reflection about the inquiry process.  A key design theme involves children reflecting on their inquiry in relation to scientific practice and collective theory building. Analyses indicate that online discourse moves reflecting epistemic inquiry (problem-centred uptake and theory building) were correlated with post-test epistemic and conceptual understanding. Classroom and interview analyses showed how students’ epistemic practice (e.g., theory revision) and epistemic reflection (connecting their own inquiry and scientists’ inquiry) might have influenced their epistemic development.  Implications of how children develop scientific epistemology supported by epistemic inquiry, discourse and reflection in a knowledge-building environment are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:22:46Z (GMT).

We do this in four different empirical contexts. Learning and remembering are understood as meaning-making processes that are dependent on and co-constituted by mediating tools that enable practices to extend across time and space. Our interests are precisely in what ways the “tools” people employ in these studies mediate activities of learning and remembering, and how they contribute to the organization of collective forms of knowing. We also address how we analyze the specific material features of tools that co-determine the unfolding of the activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:33Z (GMT).

In contrast, work in learning analytics attempts to leverage the collection and analysis of data to improve learning processes and outcomes in-situ. Developing learning analytics to support CSCL thus offers the opportunity to make our research actionable in an immediate way by using data collected on collaborative processes in-progress to inform their future trajectories. Efforts in this direction are specifically promising in support of students’ self- and socially shared- regulation of their learning. Data on collaborative and metacognitive activities can inform collaborating groups and help them to improve future joint efforts. In this symposium we bring together a collection of five papers that are exploring the space of connection between CSCL, learning analytics and self-regulation to advance thinking around these issues.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:35Z (GMT).

We present a set of seven studies that demonstrate the strong potential for the cross-fostering of ideas between educational scientists, who focus on the interventionist design-based study of learning, and social scientists, who focus on the analytic study of ambient social interaction and knowledge construction. Each study demonstrates specific insights regarding lessons that can be learned from the ambient to the designed arena, and vice versa, using lenses that integrate our various disciplinary research perspectives.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:36Z (GMT).

This symposium explores the application of this model to the learning sciences, specifically to scaffolding of computer supported collaborative learning. The symposium brings together expert researchers (working on different, related perspectives of scaffolding) to discuss their analysis of processes of learning in relation to discursive psychology and gesture analysis; conversation analysis; and multimodal interaction analysis. Each presenter will analyze and discuss the same corpus of data. These streams of data analysis are then brought together in the fourth presentation, with a discussion of visualizing and synthesizing the findings, piecing together an elaborated understanding of scaffolding. The final presentation includes the whole panel and addresses some of the challenges of conducting research this way in the learning sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:36Z (GMT).

The third project maps classroom inquiry discourse (i.e., digital notes) to spatially meaningful locations though out the classroom for collective knowledge mapping.

In higher education, instructors, especially those who teach game-related topics, attempt to incorporate game principles into the course activities and assessments, and found their efforts motivational for students. I argue that participating in gameful assessments and activities are important for teachers, not only to explore new ways of designing learning experiences, but also to better understand the gaming context of young people they work with. This paper introduces the design of a course that engaged graduate students in the concepts and practices of game-based learning. Specifically, I discuss the design of using avatars and gaining experience points as part of their course activities and assessments mediated by a social media technology, and how learners were engaged in the course in a gameful manner.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:38Z (GMT).

Computer Engineering is a resource-rich, dynamic domain, which offers opportunities for inquiry and the construction of complex knowledge objects. However, the students must learn how to engage meaningfully in such knowledge production practices and to make use of the domainʼs large pool of available resources. This study provides a better understanding of how students employ programming strategies, select and mobilize knowledge resources and collaborate to co-construct knowledge objects. A rich set of data enabled a detailed examination of these aspects. The findings emphasize the necessity for students to understand the strategies and knowledge underlying the (collaborative) programming practices, besides knowing how to apply these and to develop the capacity to explore, select and assess new knowledge resources; and, for the institutions, to provide the appropriate guiding structures for this type of learning activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:38Z (GMT).

This premise of learning in SCOLEs is analyzed in the current study. Based on the approaches of voices interanimation and polyphony, a natural language processing tool was employed for dialog analysis in integrative vs. non-integrative blog-based OKCs. Three dialog dimensions were identified: participants’ individual content-oriented contribution, social contribution, and their position within the social network. Hierarchical clusters built upon these dimensions reflect socio-cognitive structures including central, regular and peripheral OKC members. OKCs with a stronger layer of regular members appear more likely to integrate new members, whereas OKCs with a stronger layer of peripheral members appear less likely to do so. Consequently, the study suggests an automated prediction method of OKC integrativity that may sustain the educational use of OKCs.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:39Z (GMT).

The transformation seems not surprising, as group learning is generally considered to be better than individual learning, although the mechanism behind is still unclear. In a single factor experiment with 180 students, 3-person groups jointly selected research literature for a Geology course at a Multitouch Tabletop. Based on the notions of common ground and individual accountability one third of the groups performed the task collaboratively. Another third had a preceding cooperative stage involving a division of labor, whereas the remaining third of groups had a preceding “parallel” stage. Results indicate a significant difference in learning achievements favoring the parallel condition. The results are discussed in the context of learning environments in libraries.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:40Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In the context of creating narratives, concept maps can be used to represent the elements of a plot and/or the relationships between characters. Concept mapping has been shown to be an effective pre-writing strategy leading to an improvement in student writing. We have investigated the use of concept maps to help students develop narratives in an introductory undergraduate English composition course. We found that students participating in an interdisciplinary learning community (LC) who implement their narratives collaboratively as a video game using computer programming produce better concept maps than students in a traditional English composition course. We conclude that the synergies that develop between English composition and computer programming in the interdisciplinary context of a LC result in more effective concept maps leading to an improvement in students’ performance in English composition courses.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:40Z (GMT).

As a vehicle of role-play, puppetry achieves this benefit while creating a psychological distance from the role-player’s actual identity, meaning that the player’s anxiety or apprehension toward evaluation is reduced. EduceBoard is a tangible system that enables participants to conduct role-play using puppets and foster reflection based on the diverse perspectives of the characters in the role-play. Preliminary evaluation of EduceBoard demonstrated that it allowed participants to play various roles in role-play and helped them reflect on their role-play from a variety of perspectives.

In this conceptual paper, we propose an INPUT-PROCESS-OUTCOME model to guide research on the defining features, and on the conditions and effects of such productive interactions in CSCL. The model builds upon the recently proposed interactive-constructive-active-passive-framework of overt learning activities (ICAP; Chi, 2009). We propose that the interactive mode of learning is a fruitful concept for specifying what constitutes productive social interaction in CSCL, given several conceptual and methodological clarifications. The mediating role of interactive learning activities in CSCL is highlighted by the proposed INPUT-PROCESS-OUTCOME model, and supported by recent empirical findings. Building on a brief review of exemplary findings, we discuss challenges and opportunities for future research in CSCL.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We developed coding schemes to assess support levels (ranging from 0-4) provided by textual and visual evidence concerning (respectively) students’ (1) investigation plans for observing schoolyard wildlife with camera traps and (2) knowledge claims about climatic conditions in an immersive rainforest simulation. Textual evidence was found to provide greater support for the scientific practices of planning and argumentation than visual evidence. High-level visual evidence made connections to investigation plans and arguments, using (1) visual annotations (e.g., arrows), (2) comparison or contrasting images, (3) explanatory captions or (4) compositional techniques (e.g., cropping).","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:46Z (GMT).

Learning about the team members’ preferences in order to align them to accurate joint priorities for the negotiation therefore becomes an important part of the negotiation preparation. This experimental study examines, whether computer-supported awareness about the team members’ preferences (i.e. Preference Awareness) helps to foster the knowledge about these preferences within the team and thereby leads to accurate team priorities. 150 participants were randomly assigned to teams of three members with different preferences in either a condition with or without Preference Awareness. They had to prepare jointly for an upcoming negotiation via audio conference. In the condition with Preference Awareness, the priorities, which were stated by the team members afterwards, covered the preferences of all team members significantly better than in the condition without awareness.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:47Z (GMT).

After collaboration, however, it is not always clear what students internalize from this interaction. Even when students are aware of group-work benefits, effective collaboration does not necessarily occur spontaneously within the group context. To address this potential issue, the teacher can facilitate collaboration by modeling how to foster elaborative group discussions. In this paper, we evaluate how teacher modeling of collaboration prompts may increase the quantity and quality of concepts that students internalize before, during, and after collaboration. We found that students who did not observe modeling increased the quantity of connection on their post concept maps. In contrast, students who did receive modeling increased both the quantity and quality of their connections. This suggests that modeling of prompts before collaboration can deepen the internalization of concepts.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:48Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Integrating collaborative technologies into a textbook platform provides substantial opportunities for facilitating classroom discourse surrounding the textbook content. However, to be successful in a digital textbook, these technologies have to be perceived by students as useful, and must function well on the tablet platform. This paper proposes the integration of Q&A into a digital textbook platform as a way of facilitating productive collaboration, designing for the tablet, and engaging students with the technology. We describe our implementation of an integrated Q&A system and digital textbook, and outline the results of a pilot study that demonstrate how the Q&A system might be effectively used by groups of students.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:48Z (GMT).

Although the problem-solving phase is usually implemented in a collaborative setting, the role of collaboration for the effectiveness of PF remains unclear. In two quasi-experimental studies we investigated whether collaborative as compared to individual learning in PF leads to more learning. We also tested whether the beneficial PF effect could be replicated with much younger students, namely 4th and 5th graders, than previous studies. Only our first study replicated the PF effect. While the first study did not reveal differences between collaborative and individual learning, in the second study individual learners even outperformed their collaborative counterparts in both PF and DI conditions. Against these findings, we discuss possible prerequisites for PF and propose an agenda for follow-up CSCL research.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Yet, argumentation scripts run the danger of overscripting students’ argumentation. A possible solution might be to offer adaptable argumentation scripts that allow students to adjust the script to their own needs. This study compares the effects of three argumentation scripts (high structured vs. low structured vs. adaptable) on students’ argumentation skills. Furthermore, we investigate to what extent students’ self-regulation skills influence the acquisition of argumentation skills in the three conditions. N = 109 math students were randomized to the three treatment conditions and worked in dyads on mathematical proof tasks in a CSCL environment. Students’ argumentation skills increased between pre- and post-tests with comparable gains in all three conditions. Only for students learning with the adaptable argumentation script, self-regulation skills were a significant positive predictor for argumentation skills.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:49Z (GMT).

However, it is unclear how we might assess the role of embodiment in supporting student learning as compared to other modes of expression, such as verbal or visual. Furthermore, computer-supported learning activities that rely upon embodiment may be best evaluated with measures that allow students to continue to embody their knowledge during assessments. Our study presents early efforts to understand how embodiment might support or hinder 2nd graders’ expressions of states of matter (N=18). Results indicate that when students are less familiar with content or provided fewer details in other modes of communication, embodiment provides an alternative way to express their understanding. Moreover, the intervention familiarized students with how to use embodiment to express themselves which led students to yield responses which were just as nuanced as other modes of communication.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T12:54:51Z (GMT).
