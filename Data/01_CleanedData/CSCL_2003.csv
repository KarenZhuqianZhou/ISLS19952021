While we face an extension from describing learning objects to the annotation of learning services current standards for educational metadata still focus on instructionalism at the cost of neglecting collaborative and cooperative aspects of learning. Therefore it becomes important to rethink the concepts underlying current standards of educational metadata. In this paper we propose a data model that allows to describe resources that might be used for learning purposes with respect to diverse learning theories including those which are relevant in the field of CSCL.","pp. 353-362","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/AllertRN03","use,standardized,metadata,describing,educational,resource,one,ongoing,issue,field,computer-supported,learning,face,extension,describing,learning,object,annotation,learning,service,current,standard,educational,metadata,still,focus,instructionalism,cost,neglecting,collaborative,cooperative,aspect,learning,therefore,becomes,important,rethink,concept,underlying,current,standard,educational,metadata,paper,propose,data,model,allows,describe,resource,might,used,learning,purpose,respect,diverse,learning,theory,including,relevant,field,cscl","use standardized,standardized metadata,metadata describing,describing educational,educational resource,resource one,one ongoing,ongoing issue,issue field,field computer-supported,computer-supported learning,learning face,face extension,extension describing,describing learning,learning object,object annotation,annotation learning,learning service,service current,current standard,standard educational,educational metadata,metadata still,still focus,focus instructionalism,instructionalism cost,cost neglecting,neglecting collaborative,collaborative cooperative,cooperative aspect,aspect learning,learning therefore,therefore becomes,becomes important,important rethink,rethink concept,concept underlying,underlying current,current standard,standard educational,educational metadata,metadata paper,paper propose,propose data,data model,model allows,allows describe,describe resource,resource might,might used,used learning,learning purpose,purpose respect,respect diverse,diverse learning,learning theory,theory including,including relevant,relevant field,field cscl","use standardized metadata,standardized metadata describing,metadata describing educational,describing educational resource,educational resource one,resource one ongoing,one ongoing issue,ongoing issue field,issue field computer-supported,field computer-supported learning,computer-supported learning face,learning face extension,face extension describing,extension describing learning,describing learning object,learning object annotation,object annotation learning,annotation learning service,learning service current,service current standard,current standard educational,standard educational metadata,educational metadata still,metadata still focus,still focus instructionalism,focus instructionalism cost,instructionalism cost neglecting,cost neglecting collaborative,neglecting collaborative cooperative,collaborative cooperative aspect,cooperative aspect learning,aspect learning therefore,learning therefore becomes,therefore becomes important,becomes important rethink,important rethink concept,rethink concept underlying,concept underlying current,underlying current standard,current standard educational,standard educational metadata,educational metadata paper,metadata paper propose,paper propose data,propose data model,data model allows,model allows describe,allows describe resource,describe resource might,resource might used,might used learning,used learning purpose,learning purpose respect,purpose respect diverse,respect diverse learning,diverse learning theory,learning theory including,theory including relevant,including relevant field,relevant field cscl"

Therefore computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is subjected to restrictions concerning the process of communication. The effects of nonverbal signs and their relevance in collaborative virtual environments are reported. An experimental study was performed to investigate the effects of the availability of nonverbal signs on the communication process, performance measures and subjective ratings regarding the 3D virtual environment and the communication. Differences concerning objective communication variables, such as number of interruptions, did not reach the level of statistical significance. Providing nonverbal signs in collaborative virtual environments, however, leads to higher motivation and a smoother communication process.

This paper describes a design experiment with a computer-mediated feedback system for promoting class interaction called the Classroom Feedback System (CFS). We delineate specific challenges to interaction and propose design principles to address them. CFS realizes these principles and establishes a computer-mediated channel for student-initiated feedback. Students position preset annotations (e.g., MORE EXPLANATION, GOT IT) directly on the lecture slides. CFS anonymizes the annotations and presents them to the instructor in real time. Successive experiments with paper and electronic prototypes validated our design and guided iterative refinement. Evidence from a large lecture study using the feedback system suggests that CFS increases levels of student-instructor interaction and addresses specific challenges to interaction.","pp. 119-123","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/AndersonAVWY03","eliciting,student,participation,large,college,class,notoriously,difficult,yet,critical,learning,paper,describes,design,experiment,computer-mediated,feedback,system,promoting,class,interaction,called,classroom,feedback,system,cf,delineate,specific,challenge,interaction,propose,design,principle,address,cf,realizes,principle,establishes,computer-mediated,channel,student-initiated,feedback,student,position,preset,annotation,e.g.,explanation,got,directly,lecture,slide,cf,anonymizes,annotation,present,instructor,real,time,successive,experiment,paper,electronic,prototype,validated,design,guided,iterative,refinement,evidence,large,lecture,study,using,feedback,system,suggests,cf,increase,level,student-instructor,interaction,address,specific,challenge,interaction","eliciting student,student participation,participation large,large college,college class,class notoriously,notoriously difficult,difficult yet,yet critical,critical learning,learning paper,paper describes,describes design,design experiment,experiment computer-mediated,computer-mediated feedback,feedback system,system promoting,promoting class,class interaction,interaction called,called classroom,classroom feedback,feedback system,system cf,cf delineate,delineate specific,specific challenge,challenge interaction,interaction propose,propose design,design principle,principle address,address cf,cf realizes,realizes principle,principle establishes,establishes computer-mediated,computer-mediated channel,channel student-initiated,student-initiated feedback,feedback student,student position,position preset,preset annotation,annotation e.g.,e.g. explanation,explanation got,got directly,directly lecture,lecture slide,slide cf,cf anonymizes,anonymizes annotation,annotation present,present instructor,instructor real,real time,time successive,successive experiment,experiment paper,paper electronic,electronic prototype,prototype validated,validated design,design guided,guided iterative,iterative refinement,refinement evidence,evidence large,large lecture,lecture study,study using,using feedback,feedback system,system suggests,suggests cf,cf increase,increase level,level student-instructor,student-instructor interaction,interaction address,address specific,specific challenge,challenge interaction","eliciting student participation,student participation large,participation large college,large college class,college class notoriously,class notoriously difficult,notoriously difficult yet,difficult yet critical,yet critical learning,critical learning paper,learning paper describes,paper describes design,describes design experiment,design experiment computer-mediated,experiment computer-mediated feedback,computer-mediated feedback system,feedback system promoting,system promoting class,promoting class interaction,class interaction called,interaction called classroom,called classroom feedback,classroom feedback system,feedback system cf,system cf delineate,cf delineate specific,delineate specific challenge,specific challenge interaction,challenge interaction propose,interaction propose design,propose design principle,design principle address,principle address cf,address cf realizes,cf realizes principle,realizes principle establishes,principle establishes computer-mediated,establishes computer-mediated channel,computer-mediated channel student-initiated,channel student-initiated feedback,student-initiated feedback student,feedback student position,student position preset,position preset annotation,preset annotation e.g.,annotation e.g. explanation,e.g. explanation got,explanation got directly,got directly lecture,directly lecture slide,lecture slide cf,slide cf anonymizes,cf anonymizes annotation,anonymizes annotation present,annotation present instructor,present instructor real,instructor real time,real time successive,time successive experiment,successive experiment paper,experiment paper electronic,paper electronic prototype,electronic prototype validated,prototype validated design,validated design guided,design guided iterative,guided iterative refinement,iterative refinement evidence,refinement evidence large,evidence large lecture,large lecture study,lecture study using,study using feedback,using feedback system,feedback system suggests,system suggests cf,suggests cf increase,cf increase level,increase level student-instructor,level student-instructor interaction,student-instructor interaction address,interaction address specific,address specific challenge,specific challenge interaction"

Participants shared observations and follow-up responses in five weekly rounds of data collection. Using a core-periphery social network analysis model, distinctive core and periphery sub-groups were found in each of the four listservs. As measured through quality assessments of individual observational messages, mean quality was higher in each of the core groups, but results were statistically non-significant. An asymmetric hypothesis, that periphery members sent more messages to the core than vice versa, was supported by data in three groups. Early submission of observations was highly correlated with number of messages received. Fitting the core-periphery model to data from three cumulative time periods, T1, T3, and T5, for each listserv, allowed us to check for consistency in group dynamics over time.

The CSCL environment we use, enables students to collaborate on a historical inquiry task and in writing an argumentative text. In order to support historical reasoning we compared two representational tools: a graphical representation (argumentative diagram) and a linear representation (argument list). As it is assumed that an argumentative diagram can support both cognitive and interaction processes, we expected that using this tool would result in more qualitative historical reasoning, in the chat as well as in the text. However, the results of this study did not show a significant difference in the amount and type of historical reasoning between the two conditions.

We do this in taking existing methodologies as our starting point. The central questions are: What methodologies do we have to examine complex phenomena within learning environments? How can the field meet the dual challenge of contributing to theory and practice? And to what extent and in what ways do existing methodologies reflect principles of scientific research? In pursuing these questions, we outline the principles of scientific research proposed by the National Research Council (2001). Then we apply these principles in an analysis of two prototypical methodologies that respond to the challenge of examining complex phenomena related to learning environments in situated practice. These methodologies are design research and the integrative research paradigm. These methodologies converge along some lines while differ on others. The focus of our comparative analysis is to articulate the underlying assumptions of these methodologies, to reconsider currently depicted dichotomies, and to develop a common language of principles for use-inspired basic research. As conclusions, three tasks are defined for future research practice: (1) becoming more explicit on method in scientific contributions, (2) specifying scientific standards for the field of complex learning environment research, and (3) developing complementary practical impact standards.","pp. 493-502","Conference and Workshop

The model is based on a post-disciplinary approach to knowledge and educational design that sees any field of study in terms of the people who work in the area and who are seen to be members of its knowledge community. Drawing on these ideas, the networked environment is built as a collection of hyperlinks of representations of the field by recognized members of the knowledge community. A key feature of the model is the support of asynchronous reflective discussion among participants enabled through online learning sets. The paper concludes by identifying the areas which apparently hinder the environment from becoming fully integrated within the overall design of the programme.","pp. 405-409","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/HodgsonZ03","paper,introduces,innovative,model,developing,sustaining,networked,environment,geographically,dispersed,learner,model,based,post-disciplinary,approach,knowledge,educational,design,see,field,study,term,people,work,area,seen,member,knowledge,community,drawing,idea,networked,environment,built,collection,hyperlink,representation,field,recognized,member,knowledge,community,key,feature,model,support,asynchronous,reflective,discussion,among,participant,enabled,online,learning,set,paper,concludes,identifying,area,apparently,hinder,environment,becoming,fully,integrated,within,overall,design,programme","paper introduces,introduces innovative,innovative model,model developing,developing sustaining,sustaining networked,networked environment,environment geographically,geographically dispersed,dispersed learner,learner model,model based,based post-disciplinary,post-disciplinary approach,approach knowledge,knowledge educational,educational design,design see,see field,field study,study term,term people,people work,work area,area seen,seen member,member knowledge,knowledge community,community drawing,drawing idea,idea networked,networked environment,environment built,built collection,collection hyperlink,hyperlink representation,representation field,field recognized,recognized member,member knowledge,knowledge community,community key,key feature,feature model,model support,support asynchronous,asynchronous reflective,reflective discussion,discussion among,among participant,participant enabled,enabled online,online learning,learning set,set paper,paper concludes,concludes identifying,identifying area,area apparently,apparently hinder,hinder environment,environment becoming,becoming fully,fully integrated,integrated within,within overall,overall design,design programme","paper introduces innovative,introduces innovative model,innovative model developing,model developing sustaining,developing sustaining networked,sustaining networked environment,networked environment geographically,environment geographically dispersed,geographically dispersed learner,dispersed learner model,learner model based,model based post-disciplinary,based post-disciplinary approach,post-disciplinary approach knowledge,approach knowledge educational,knowledge educational design,educational design see,design see field,see field study,field study term,study term people,term people work,people work area,work area seen,area seen member,seen member knowledge,member knowledge community,knowledge community drawing,community drawing idea,drawing idea networked,idea networked environment,networked environment built,environment built collection,built collection hyperlink,collection hyperlink representation,hyperlink representation field,representation field recognized,field recognized member,recognized member knowledge,member knowledge community,knowledge community key,community key feature,key feature model,feature model support,model support asynchronous,support asynchronous reflective,asynchronous reflective discussion,reflective discussion among,discussion among participant,among participant enabled,participant enabled online,enabled online learning,online learning set,learning set paper,set paper concludes,paper concludes identifying,concludes identifying area,identifying area apparently,area apparently hinder,apparently hinder environment,hinder environment becoming,environment becoming fully,becoming fully integrated,fully integrated within,integrated within overall,within overall design,overall design programme"
23,5307859,"Hübscher-Younger, Teresa||Narayanan, N. Hari","Designing for Divergence","Constructionist theories hold that learning will be deeper if students develop and share their own diverse understandings of a concept. College students are immersed in a community with its social norms, learning practices and an understanding of authority and the classroom contract. This situation makes it difficult for the students to have diverse understandings of a concept. This paper addresses how this affects the nature and diversity of representations students create for collaborative learning, and their perceptions of the quality of representations created by their peers. We redesigned and deployed a CSCL system with the goals of facilitating learning by leveraging students’ current collaborative learning practices and changing their perceptions of authority. We present summary results from two studies, which are part of an ongoing research program investigating these questions. In prior research we found that students have a strong sense of which style of representation is authoritative, and that this can lead to premature convergence and the suppression of alternative viewpoints. Results from the current studies indicate that creating, sharing and evaluating representations through a CSCL system improve learning. Furthermore, careful design of the CSCL system and learning activities can indeed lead to an increase in the diversity of created representations, avoiding some problems we saw previously with early convergence. However, authority still influences representational creation and evaluation. We revisit our design goals and recommendations in light of these results.","pp. 461-470","Conference and Workshop

The focus is on how to design supporting media in relation to how users jointly constructed a shared understanding of the tasks at hand. We explore the collaborative tasks of constructing collages using episodes of recorded speech, including tutorial dialogues and broadcast talk. The practices were devised, recorded and analysed both in digital environments such as Powerpoint, and in physical settings in which hard-paper snapshots embodied the video-clips. We report problems that emerge from such practices that relate to the open interpretation of the representations, and the need to rely on this to achieve active spectatorship. Our discussion relies on how users collaboratively conduct the tasks and appropriate the tools.

For an utterance to serve as a problematizing move, however, it must be followed by an uptake move on the part of one or more interlocutors.

We analyze student work and conversations while working with CPEs using Contextual Inquiry. Findings highlight the differences in activity patterns between groups using different CPEs. Students using Stagecast Creator (SC) did twice as much planning but half as much debugging compared with students using Microworlds (MW). Students working with MW were using written code on the computer screen to communicate their ideas whereas students working with SC were using the programming language to talk about their ideas prior to any programming. We propose three areas for future research. (1) Exploring different types of communication styles as compared with the use of different CPEs. (2) Identifying students' nascent abilities for using CPEs to show functionality in science. (3) Further understanding CPEs’ design characteristics as to which may promote or hamper learning with models in science.","pp. 109-118","Conference and Workshop

33,5307869,"Ludvigsen, Sten R.||Mørch, Anders I.","Categorisation in Knowledge Building","In this paper we explore how students talk and reason when they are exposed to a set of categories taken from scientific discourse. The scientific categories are built into a web-based discussion forum (FLE2) as part of a pedagogical and technological design. The scientific categories are based on the concepts of the progressive inquiry model for knowledge building. Sociocultural theory, with a focus on concepts like categories and prompting, is our theoretical framework. In the DoCTA NSS project we have used the progressive inquiry model to explore how the students use categories to collaboratively develop new understanding of a specific knowledge domain. Based on the theoretical framework and an empirical example, we argue that the progressive inquiry model — in its conceptual form — is too rationalistic for student knowledge building. We found that student knowledge building is task-specific and local oriented, rather than aimed at conceptual artefacts.","pp. 67-76","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/LudvigsenM03","paper,explore,student,talk,reason,exposed,set,category,taken,scientific,discourse,scientific,category,built,web-based,discussion,forum,fle2,part,pedagogical,technological,design,scientific,category,based,concept,progressive,inquiry,model,knowledge,building,sociocultural,theory,focus,concept,like,category,prompting,theoretical,framework,docta,n,project,used,progressive,inquiry,model,explore,student,use,category,collaboratively,develop,new,understanding,specific,knowledge,domain,based,theoretical,framework,empirical,example,argue,progressive,inquiry,model,—,conceptual,form,—,rationalistic,student,knowledge,building,found,student,knowledge,building,task-specific,local,oriented,rather,aimed,conceptual,artefact","paper explore,explore student,student talk,talk reason,reason exposed,exposed set,set category,category taken,taken scientific,scientific discourse,discourse scientific,scientific category,category built,built web-based,web-based discussion,discussion forum,forum fle2,fle2 part,part pedagogical,pedagogical technological,technological design,design scientific,scientific category,category based,based concept,concept progressive,progressive inquiry,inquiry model,model knowledge,knowledge building,building sociocultural,sociocultural theory,theory focus,focus concept,concept like,like category,category prompting,prompting theoretical,theoretical framework,framework docta,docta n,n project,project used,used progressive,progressive inquiry,inquiry model,model explore,explore student,student use,use category,category collaboratively,collaboratively develop,develop new,new understanding,understanding specific,specific knowledge,knowledge domain,domain based,based theoretical,theoretical framework,framework empirical,empirical example,example argue,argue progressive,progressive inquiry,inquiry model,model —,— conceptual,conceptual form,form —,— rationalistic,rationalistic student,student knowledge,knowledge building,building found,found student,student knowledge,knowledge building,building task-specific,task-specific local,local oriented,oriented rather,rather aimed,aimed conceptual,conceptual artefact","paper explore student,explore student talk,student talk reason,talk reason exposed,reason exposed set,exposed set category,set category taken,category taken scientific,taken scientific discourse,scientific discourse scientific,discourse scientific category,scientific category built,category built web-based,built web-based discussion,web-based discussion forum,discussion forum fle2,forum fle2 part,fle2 part pedagogical,part pedagogical technological,pedagogical technological design,technological design scientific,design scientific category,scientific category based,category based concept,based concept progressive,concept progressive inquiry,progressive inquiry model,inquiry model knowledge,model knowledge building,knowledge building sociocultural,building sociocultural theory,sociocultural theory focus,theory focus concept,focus concept like,concept like category,like category prompting,category prompting theoretical,prompting theoretical framework,theoretical framework docta,framework docta n,docta n project,n project used,project used progressive,used progressive inquiry,progressive inquiry model,inquiry model explore,model explore student,explore student use,student use category,use category collaboratively,category collaboratively develop,collaboratively develop new,develop new understanding,new understanding specific,understanding specific knowledge,specific knowledge domain,knowledge domain based,domain based theoretical,based theoretical framework,theoretical framework empirical,framework empirical example,empirical example argue,example argue progressive,argue progressive inquiry,progressive inquiry model,inquiry model —,model — conceptual,— conceptual form,conceptual form —,form — rationalistic,— rationalistic student,rationalistic student knowledge,student knowledge building,knowledge building found,building found student,found student knowledge,student knowledge building,knowledge building task-specific,building task-specific local,task-specific local oriented,local oriented rather,oriented rather aimed,rather aimed conceptual,aimed conceptual artefact"

It relies on information captured from the actions performed by the participants during the collaborative process. This information includes data of distinct nature and format, which demands a flexible and standardised data representation, adaptable to different analytical perspectives and collaborative situations. Besides this, it is known that the correct interpretation of human action needs to take context into account. We propose in this paper our approach towards the definition of an XML-based representation of source data, which includes a description of the context of collaboration, and offers a common representation for data of different origin and nature. It is extensible, and independent of the subsequent data analysis methods to which it might be applied.

In this paper a generalisation and modification of a concept, which has recently been suggested for engineering design, is discussed. The uniqueness of the proposed new breed of computer supported student contests arises from assessing tele-collaboration as part of the competition scoring. Recent web based contests are observed indicating that some early birds of the new breed may already exists. In addition to outlining the suggested generic methodology and some of its’ pedagogical and computer supported aspects, initial research activities towards scientific assessment of students’ tele-collaboration are reported.

Moreover, subtle signals often stay unnoticed. In the current work, we focus on improving people's natural questioning behaviour in video-based design teams. We performed a quasi-experimental study to investigate if either a questioning tool or a facilitator stimulated reflective behaviour and therefore stimulated learning and understanding. We compared twenty teams that performed a complex design task; ten of these teams had next to audio and video support a questioning tool available. Preliminary results showed that perceived shared understanding increased over time, and that teams with both a facilitator and the tool understood each other best, which was in line with our hypotheses. On the other hand, we found that teams with neither a facilitator and nor the questioning tool posed most questions.","pp. 421-430","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/MulderGSK03","video,communication,seem,generally,accepted,habit,make,questioning,explicit,instance,explicit,signal,hand,raising,time-out,sign,moreover,subtle,signal,often,stay,unnoticed,current,work,focus,improving,people,'s,natural,questioning,behaviour,video-based,design,team,performed,quasi-experimental,study,investigate,either,questioning,tool,facilitator,stimulated,reflective,behaviour,therefore,stimulated,learning,understanding,compared,twenty,team,performed,complex,design,task,ten,team,next,audio,video,support,questioning,tool,available,preliminary,result,showed,perceived,shared,understanding,increased,time,team,facilitator,tool,understood,best,line,hypothesis,hand,found,team,neither,facilitator,questioning,tool,posed,question","video communication,communication seem,seem generally,generally accepted,accepted habit,habit make,make questioning,questioning explicit,explicit instance,instance explicit,explicit signal,signal hand,hand raising,raising time-out,time-out sign,sign moreover,moreover subtle,subtle signal,signal often,often stay,stay unnoticed,unnoticed current,current work,work focus,focus improving,improving people,people 's,'s natural,natural questioning,questioning behaviour,behaviour video-based,video-based design,design team,team performed,performed quasi-experimental,quasi-experimental study,study investigate,investigate either,either questioning,questioning tool,tool facilitator,facilitator stimulated,stimulated reflective,reflective behaviour,behaviour therefore,therefore stimulated,stimulated learning,learning understanding,understanding compared,compared twenty,twenty team,team performed,performed complex,complex design,design task,task ten,ten team,team next,next audio,audio video,video support,support questioning,questioning tool,tool available,available preliminary,preliminary result,result showed,showed perceived,perceived shared,shared understanding,understanding increased,increased time,time team,team facilitator,facilitator tool,tool understood,understood best,best line,line hypothesis,hypothesis hand,hand found,found team,team neither,neither facilitator,facilitator questioning,questioning tool,tool posed,posed question","video communication seem,communication seem generally,seem generally accepted,generally accepted habit,accepted habit make,habit make questioning,make questioning explicit,questioning explicit instance,explicit instance explicit,instance explicit signal,explicit signal hand,signal hand raising,hand raising time-out,raising time-out sign,time-out sign moreover,sign moreover subtle,moreover subtle signal,subtle signal often,signal often stay,often stay unnoticed,stay unnoticed current,unnoticed current work,current work focus,work focus improving,focus improving people,improving people 's,people 's natural,'s natural questioning,natural questioning behaviour,questioning behaviour video-based,behaviour video-based design,video-based design team,design team performed,team performed quasi-experimental,performed quasi-experimental study,quasi-experimental study investigate,study investigate either,investigate either questioning,either questioning tool,questioning tool facilitator,tool facilitator stimulated,facilitator stimulated reflective,stimulated reflective behaviour,reflective behaviour therefore,behaviour therefore stimulated,therefore stimulated learning,stimulated learning understanding,learning understanding compared,understanding compared twenty,compared twenty team,twenty team performed,team performed complex,performed complex design,complex design task,design task ten,task ten team,ten team next,team next audio,next audio video,audio video support,video support questioning,support questioning tool,questioning tool available,tool available preliminary,available preliminary result,preliminary result showed,result showed perceived,showed perceived shared,perceived shared understanding,shared understanding increased,understanding increased time,increased time team,time team facilitator,team facilitator tool,facilitator tool understood,tool understood best,understood best line,best line hypothesis,line hypothesis hand,hypothesis hand found,hand found team,found team neither,team neither facilitator,neither facilitator questioning,facilitator questioning tool,questioning tool posed,tool posed question"

Both participants share time, space, vision, experiences, and emotion between the two different worlds. We conducted experiments on DigitalEE II to verify voluntary environmental learning through interactive communication. The experiments found that the desire to fill information gap between real and virtual worlds stimulated various interactive communication and voluntary environmental observation.

The process of design on whiteboard tool and the textual conversation on chat tool were recorded and the content was analysed from log-files. Based on the individuals’ external problem representations and the interactions recorded on whiteboards, the theoretical framework for the analysis of problem representations in science was created. According to this, the development of students’ problem representations must be supported on the dimensions of the ontological “objects” and “events” category components of mental models at the levels of everyday, scientific and scientific symbolic explanations. It was found that the collaborative modelling activity in the synchronous network environment caused the shift in students’ individual problem representations towards more complete and scientifically valid mental models.","pp. 189-198","Conference and Workshop

However, often students’ virtual and physical environments are not essentially separated. Likewise, scholars should become more sensitive to and aware of their research principles and practices guiding studies in virtual settings and especially, in the intersections of on- and offline contexts. The participant experience method discussed in this paper, grants access also to the events outside the virtual learning context connecting various social settings and simultaneous events. However, the use of participant experience methods requires critical reflection during its various phases and levels of implementation. Firstly, during the fieldwork, the relationship between researcher and researched should be reflected and the representation and reconstruction of these, often intense, field experiences into the field texts should be focused on. Secondly, the process and the inquiry that moulds the field documents into the research account should be highlighted. In order to represent both the researchers’ voices and the voices of the other social actors from the field, a multi-voiced analysis implemented as a split-text narrative is proposed.","pp.

With the influx of wireless technologies, new opportunities have been opened for designing novel computer-supported environments that support a wider range of collaborative interactions. For instance, collaboration can take on different forms, such as, adult-child collaboration or peer-peer collaboration, local or remote collaboration involving different forms of mobile communications. Moreover, depending on the type of collaboration, learners can experience a different kind of interaction, which can enable them to reflect in different ways. Using multiple collaborative interactions that facilitate diverse forms of reflection allows us to begin to explore the learning process in more detail. This paper presents a new conceptual framework for investigating and analysing how multiple collaborative interactions may support different forms of reflection. The framework is used here to analyse and inform the design of a novel mixed reality learning environment for children.

48,5307884,"Reffay, Christophe||Chanier, Thierry","How Social Network Analysis can help to Measure Cohesion in Collaborative Distance-Learning","It has been argued that cohesion plays a central role in collaborative learning. In face-to-face classes, it can be reckoned from several visual or oral cues. In a Learning Management System or CSCL environment, such cues are absent. In this paper, we show that Social Network Analysis concepts, adapted to the collaborative distance-learning context, can help measuring the cohesion of small groups.

This new structure aims at facilitating the emergence of learning conversations in these learning communities. These threaded conversations take place in a forum-type tool that uses a tree data structure composed of threads to organize group communication. We identify two situations which discourage the emergence of the learning conversations taking place in threaded based tools. We are interested in, namely “interactional incoherence” and “sequential incoherence”. For each of these identified drawbacks, we conceive mechanisms which intend to surmount these incoherencies: first, the localization of topics in a message, based on the “what you answer is what you link” criteria; and second, a visualization that allows merging in a single view the time order and the thread order of the messages.

The two instructional measures investigated — learning by observing a worked-out collaboration example and learning from a scripted collaboration — were designed on the basis of a thorough analysis of what characterizes a good collaboration in the given scenario. To evaluate their effectiveness, an experiment was conducted. Not only the outcome of a subsequent collaboration and a posttest, but also the collaborative process itself were analyzed as dependent variables. The results give evidence of the potential of the two measures to promote collaborative competences. Compared to two control conditions, participants subsequently show a more sensible collaboration and achieve better results.

51,5307887,"Säljö, Roger","Representational Tools and the Transformation of Learning","Human learning, following Vygotsky, Dewey and others, is the appropriation and mastery of knowledge and skills that have accumulated in society. This ability to accumulate experiences over generations, and to communicate them in time and space, are two of the features that are so distinctive for the human species. A corollary of such a perspective on learning, and one that contrasts with most theoretical traditions, is that learning, and cognition in general, are historical phenomena subject to change in nature as the fabric of social practices changes, and as the mechanisms for storing and communicating information are transformed. Dewey recognised this sociohistorical contingency of cognition when pointing out that we have to rid ourselves “of the notion that “thinking” is a single, unalterable faculty” (1909/1997, p. 38). Already a hundred years ago, he argued in his vivid metaphorical language that “thinking is specific” and “not like a sausage machine which reduces all materials indifferently to one marketable commodity.” (p. 39).","pp. 1-2","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/Saljo03","human,learning,following,vygotsky,dewey,others,appropriation,mastery,knowledge,skill,accumulated,society,ability,accumulate,experience,generation,communicate,time,space,two,feature,distinctive,human,specie,corollary,perspective,learning,one,contrast,theoretical,tradition,learning,cognition,general,historical,phenomenon,subject,change,nature,fabric,social,practice,change,mechanism,storing,communicating,information,transformed,dewey,recognised,sociohistorical,contingency,cognition,pointing,rid,“,notion,“,thinking,”,single,unalterable,faculty,”,1909/1997,p.,38,already,hundred,year,ago,argued,vivid,metaphorical,language,“,thinking,specific,”,“,like,sausage,machine,reduces,material,indifferently,one,marketable,commodity.,”,p.,39","human learning,learning following,following vygotsky,vygotsky dewey,dewey others,others appropriation,appropriation mastery,mastery knowledge,knowledge skill,skill accumulated,accumulated society,society ability,ability accumulate,accumulate experience,experience generation,generation communicate,communicate time,time space,space two,two feature,feature distinctive,distinctive human,human specie,specie corollary,corollary perspective,perspective learning,learning one,one contrast,contrast theoretical,theoretical tradition,tradition learning,learning cognition,cognition general,general historical,historical phenomenon,phenomenon subject,subject change,change nature,nature fabric,fabric social,social practice,practice change,change mechanism,mechanism storing,storing communicating,communicating information,information transformed,transformed dewey,dewey recognised,recognised sociohistorical,sociohistorical contingency,contingency cognition,cognition pointing,pointing rid,rid “,“ notion,notion “,“ thinking,thinking ”,” single,single unalterable,unalterable faculty,faculty ”,” 1909/1997,1909/1997 p.,p. 38,38 already,already hundred,hundred year,year ago,ago argued,argued vivid,vivid metaphorical,metaphorical language,language “,“ thinking,thinking specific,specific ”,” “,“ like,like sausage,sausage machine,machine reduces,reduces material,material indifferently,indifferently one,one marketable,marketable commodity.,commodity. ”,” p.,p. 39","human learning following,learning following vygotsky,following vygotsky dewey,vygotsky dewey others,dewey others appropriation,others appropriation mastery,appropriation mastery knowledge,mastery knowledge skill,knowledge skill accumulated,skill accumulated society,accumulated society ability,society ability accumulate,ability accumulate experience,accumulate experience generation,experience generation communicate,generation communicate time,communicate time space,time space two,space two feature,two feature distinctive,feature distinctive human,distinctive human specie,human specie corollary,specie corollary perspective,corollary perspective learning,perspective learning one,learning one contrast,one contrast theoretical,contrast theoretical tradition,theoretical tradition learning,tradition learning cognition,learning cognition general,cognition general historical,general historical phenomenon,historical phenomenon subject,phenomenon subject change,subject change nature,change nature fabric,nature fabric social,fabric social practice,social practice change,practice change mechanism,change mechanism storing,mechanism storing communicating,storing communicating information,communicating information transformed,information transformed dewey,transformed dewey recognised,dewey recognised sociohistorical,recognised sociohistorical contingency,sociohistorical contingency cognition,contingency cognition pointing,cognition pointing rid,pointing rid “,rid “ notion,“ notion “,notion “ thinking,“ thinking ”,thinking ” single,” single unalterable,single unalterable faculty,unalterable faculty ”,faculty ” 1909/1997,” 1909/1997 p.,1909/1997 p. 38,p. 38 already,38 already hundred,already hundred year,hundred year ago,year ago argued,ago argued vivid,argued vivid metaphorical,vivid metaphorical language,metaphorical language “,language “ thinking,“ thinking specific,thinking specific ”,specific ” “,” “ like,“ like sausage,like sausage machine,sausage machine reduces,machine reduces material,reduces material indifferently,material indifferently one,indifferently one marketable,one marketable commodity.,marketable commodity. ”,commodity. ” p.,” p. 39"

However, these meanings must be interpreted by individuals. There is a dynamic relationship between shared meanings and individual interpretations: In order to engage in collaborative activities, people must come to recognize meanings of artifacts, and interpret these meanings from their own perspectives.

An experience was developed which involved a paper-based ‘history hunt’ around a castle searching for clues about historical events that happened at the site. The clues involved people making drawings or rubbings on paper at a variety of locations. The paper was then electronically tagged and used to interact with a story tent. This consisted of a tarpaulin structure with projections on either side. A Radio Frequency ID tag reader and ultra violet light were positioned inside the tent. When placed on the tag reader, each paper clue revealed an historic 3D environment of the castle from the location at which the clue was found.’ secret writing’ revealed the story of a character at this location, while 2D images on the tent displayed corresponding scenes from this historical period. Visitors to the castle over 4 days took part in this experience. Video analysis of children and adults in the Storytent suggest that the quality of adult engagement reflects the extent to which children discover and make connections. The importance of these findings is discussed in relation to future design of mixed reality technologies to support collaborative learning.","pp. 293-302","Conference and Workshop

The underlying philosophy of these systems is that CSCL systems should raise the levels of learners’ motivation and participation in a learning situation.

Through evaluations in elementary schools, we have found that enhancing authenticity while retaining a sense of play is critical for engaging children in their learning. Epro2, the system proposed in this paper, is used for learning about urban planning and environmental issues by integrating physical and virtual spaces. In Epro2, multiple sensing boards are placed in physically different locations and connected through a computer network. Physical towns are constructed by children on boards that are brought together in a virtual neighborhood, in such a way that they affect each other. Children in Epro2 not only design a town in a face-to-face setting, but also negotiate with other children located elsewhere through a chat system. We also designed a curriculum in cooperation with teachers, and evaluated the system in classrooms. Several lessons learned through the evaluations are described.","pp. 303-312","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/SugimotoKIT003","far,developed,system,sense,play,supporting,group,learning,evaluation,elementary,school,found,enhancing,authenticity,retaining,sense,play,critical,engaging,child,learning,epro2,system,proposed,paper,used,learning,urban,planning,environmental,issue,integrating,physical,virtual,space,epro2,multiple,sensing,board,placed,physically,different,location,connected,computer,network,physical,town,constructed,child,board,brought,together,virtual,neighborhood,way,affect,child,epro2,design,town,face-to-face,setting,also,negotiate,child,located,elsewhere,chat,system,also,designed,curriculum,cooperation,teacher,evaluated,system,classroom,several,lesson,learned,evaluation,described","far developed,developed system,system sense,sense play,play supporting,supporting group,group learning,learning evaluation,evaluation elementary,elementary school,school found,found enhancing,enhancing authenticity,authenticity retaining,retaining sense,sense play,play critical,critical engaging,engaging child,child learning,learning epro2,epro2 system,system proposed,proposed paper,paper used,used learning,learning urban,urban planning,planning environmental,environmental issue,issue integrating,integrating physical,physical virtual,virtual space,space epro2,epro2 multiple,multiple sensing,sensing board,board placed,placed physically,physically different,different location,location connected,connected computer,computer network,network physical,physical town,town constructed,constructed child,child board,board brought,brought together,together virtual,virtual neighborhood,neighborhood way,way affect,affect child,child epro2,epro2 design,design town,town face-to-face,face-to-face setting,setting also,also negotiate,negotiate child,child located,located elsewhere,elsewhere chat,chat system,system also,also designed,designed curriculum,curriculum cooperation,cooperation teacher,teacher evaluated,evaluated system,system classroom,classroom several,several lesson,lesson learned,learned evaluation,evaluation described","far developed system,developed system sense,system sense play,sense play supporting,play supporting group,supporting group learning,group learning evaluation,learning evaluation elementary,evaluation elementary school,elementary school found,school found enhancing,found enhancing authenticity,enhancing authenticity retaining,authenticity retaining sense,retaining sense play,sense play critical,play critical engaging,critical engaging child,engaging child learning,child learning epro2,learning epro2 system,epro2 system proposed,system proposed paper,proposed paper used,paper used learning,used learning urban,learning urban planning,urban planning environmental,planning environmental issue,environmental issue integrating,issue integrating physical,integrating physical virtual,physical virtual space,virtual space epro2,space epro2 multiple,epro2 multiple sensing,multiple sensing board,sensing board placed,board placed physically,placed physically different,physically different location,different location connected,location connected computer,connected computer network,computer network physical,network physical town,physical town constructed,town constructed child,constructed child board,child board brought,board brought together,brought together virtual,together virtual neighborhood,virtual neighborhood way,neighborhood way affect,way affect child,affect child epro2,child epro2 design,epro2 design town,design town face-to-face,town face-to-face setting,face-to-face setting also,setting also negotiate,also negotiate child,negotiate child located,child located elsewhere,located elsewhere chat,elsewhere chat system,chat system also,system also designed,also designed curriculum,designed curriculum cooperation,curriculum cooperation teacher,cooperation teacher evaluated,teacher evaluated system,evaluated system classroom,system classroom several,classroom several lesson,several lesson learned,lesson learned evaluation,learned evaluation described"

An important role of shared representations in collaborative learning is to facilitate the ease of reference to previously introduced ideas. Complex ideas are more easily expressed when their component ideas can be indicated with simple gestures. Yet gesture does not have the same immediacy in typical online learning environments. We examined the extent to which gestural deixis is inhibited online, and how shared representations serve as conversational resources in other ways. Results show that gesture was almost never used online, and was partially replaced with verbal deixis and direct manipulation of the shared representation. Verbal deixis almost always referenced ideas already in the focus of attention, posing a potential problem for reflection on prior information. These results suggest the importance of better integration between communicative tools and shared representations and the inclusion of prompts for reflection.","pp. 173-182","Conference and Workshop

58,5307894,"Ulicsak, Mary Helen","Group Skill Usage: The Accuracy and Impact of Self-Assessment and Feedback","A group activity in a school has two aims: i) the participants gain domain knowledge or skills, and ii) the participants develop the skills needed to work in a team. These group skills, such as listening, taking turns, providing justification, are not instinctive and often cannot be accurately assessed by children. However, if used they improve the task performance and individual understanding. The CSCL system described raises awareness of actual and appropriate behaviour by reminding and scaffolding children aged 9 and 10 about group skills while performing a group activity. The system was based on existing training schemes, including procedural prompting, assigning roles, modelling exchanges, and giving feedback. This feedback, based on self-assessments, was found to correlate with the opinion of teachers observing the group activities. It was also found the majority of children who improved in group skill usage became more consistent when analysing their own behaviour in group activities.","pp. 209-218","Conference and Workshop Papers","https://dblp.org/rec/conf/cscl/Ulicsak03","group,activity,school,two,aim,participant,gain,domain,knowledge,skill,ii,participant,develop,skill,needed,work,team,group,skill,listening,taking,turn,providing,justification,instinctive,often,accurately,assessed,child,however,used,improve,task,performance,individual,understanding,cscl,system,described,raise,awareness,actual,appropriate,behaviour,reminding,scaffolding,child,aged,9,10,group,skill,performing,group,activity,system,based,existing,training,scheme,including,procedural,prompting,assigning,role,modelling,exchange,giving,feedback,feedback,based,self-assessments,found,correlate,opinion,teacher,observing,group,activity,also,found,majority,child,improved,group,skill,usage,became,consistent,analysing,behaviour,group,activity","group activity,activity school,school two,two aim,aim participant,participant gain,gain domain,domain knowledge,knowledge skill,skill ii,ii participant,participant develop,develop skill,skill needed,needed work,work team,team group,group skill,skill listening,listening taking,taking turn,turn providing,providing justification,justification instinctive,instinctive often,often accurately,accurately assessed,assessed child,child however,however used,used improve,improve task,task performance,performance individual,individual understanding,understanding cscl,cscl system,system described,described raise,raise awareness,awareness actual,actual appropriate,appropriate behaviour,behaviour reminding,reminding scaffolding,scaffolding child,child aged,aged 9,9 10,10 group,group skill,skill performing,performing group,group activity,activity system,system based,based existing,existing training,training scheme,scheme including,including procedural,procedural prompting,prompting assigning,assigning role,role modelling,modelling exchange,exchange giving,giving feedback,feedback feedback,feedback based,based self-assessments,self-assessments found,found correlate,correlate opinion,opinion teacher,teacher observing,observing group,group activity,activity also,also found,found majority,majority child,child improved,improved group,group skill,skill usage,usage became,became consistent,consistent analysing,analysing behaviour,behaviour group,group activity","group activity school,activity school two,school two aim,two aim participant,aim participant gain,participant gain domain,gain domain knowledge,domain knowledge skill,knowledge skill ii,skill ii participant,ii participant develop,participant develop skill,develop skill needed,skill needed work,needed work team,work team group,team group skill,group skill listening,skill listening taking,listening taking turn,taking turn providing,turn providing justification,providing justification instinctive,justification instinctive often,instinctive often accurately,often accurately assessed,accurately assessed child,assessed child however,child however used,however used improve,used improve task,improve task performance,task performance individual,performance individual understanding,individual understanding cscl,understanding cscl system,cscl system described,system described raise,described raise awareness,raise awareness actual,awareness actual appropriate,actual appropriate behaviour,appropriate behaviour reminding,behaviour reminding scaffolding,reminding scaffolding child,scaffolding child aged,child aged 9,aged 9 10,9 10 group,10 group skill,group skill performing,skill performing group,performing group activity,group activity system,activity system based,system based existing,based existing training,existing training scheme,training scheme including,scheme including procedural,including procedural prompting,procedural prompting assigning,prompting assigning role,assigning role modelling,role modelling exchange,modelling exchange giving,exchange giving feedback,giving feedback feedback,feedback feedback based,feedback based self-assessments,based self-assessments found,self-assessments found correlate,found correlate opinion,correlate opinion teacher,opinion teacher observing,teacher observing group,observing group activity,group activity also,activity also found,also found majority,found majority child,majority child improved,child improved group,improved group skill,group skill usage,skill usage became,usage became consistent,became consistent analysing,consistent analysing behaviour,analysing behaviour group,behaviour group activity"

An automated feedback mechanism has been used to enhance interaction and group well-being during computer supported collaborative learning. We tracked individual contribution behavior as well as learners’ motivation during collaborative problem-solving by means of an asynchronous communication platform. These data have been used to automatically generate visual aids, providing feedback about group members’ participation as well as motivational clues. A second feedback mechanism has been applied by aggregating learners’ problem solving discourse into a meta-document. This document revealed groups’ problem-solving strategies as well as their progress during different problem solving stages. We examined how this scaffolding methodology based on a group’s own behavior enhanced problem-solving outcomes.
