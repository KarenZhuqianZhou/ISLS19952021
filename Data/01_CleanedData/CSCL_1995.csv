Industry design practice suggests that users should be able have direct control of the windowing display system. In order to conform to industry practice the IdeaWeb was redesigned from a single window display system to a modeless tiled window display system. It was assumed that a modeless windowing system would be preferable because the underlying graphic display system was dynamic. The results indicate that the students generally opted for a single window display system which is consistent with much of the previous research. Sequence data from the event logs demonstrate that students chose to treat the modeless window as static or modal. It appears that the students were concentrating on the cognitive task of managing the on-going computer mediated discussion. This study has important consequences for screen and window design not only for developing on-line conference systems, but within multimedia systems that have dense cognitive material. If the cognitive requirements of the main window are high, then a titled windowing system that requires little user intervention appears to be the design choice. However, if the requirement to recall information from window to window is low then a single window system display system is more appropriate. This would reduce not only the cognitive but the design and programming overhead as well.","Papers","goal,study,investigate,effect,window,state,management,ability,user,maintain,coherent,interaction,within,on-line,me­diated,conference,industry,design,practice,suggests,user,able,direct,control,windowing,display,system,order,conform,industry,practice,ideaweb,redesigned,single,window,display,system,modeless,tiled,window,display,system,assumed,modeless,windowing,system,would,preferable,underlying,graphic,display,system,dynamic,result,indicate,student,generally,opted,single,window,display,system,consistent,much,previous,research,sequence,data,event,log,demonstrate,student,chose,treat,modeless,window,static,modal,appears,student,concentrating,cognitive,task,managing,on-going,computer,mediated,discussion,study,important,consequence,screen,window,design,developing,on-line,conference,system,within,multimedia,system,dense,cognitive,material,cognitive,requirement,main,window,high,titled,windowing,system,requires,little,user,intervention,appears,design,choice,however,requirement,recall,information,window,window,low,single,window,system,display,system,appropriate,would,reduce,cognitive,design,programming,overhead,well","goal

When a collaborative situation makes team members dependent on each other's actions for success, their negotiations during problem solving ought also to provide a window into their reasoning. However, in work with young children none of this is straightforward. At first sight their collaboration may look like it creates more opportunities for misunderstanding than for learning, and their reasoning does not make the conceptual content very explicit. A hermeneutic analysis which follows simultaneously the development of the varying perspectives from which the individual participants' understand the task, and the development of a joint approach to the task may provide a useful window into the learning process. The paper presents some highlights from an example of this kind of hermeneutic analysis. The development of the interaction between two children playing a new game intended to promote a conception of ""the system of numbers as a whole-to-parts system""'illustrates how children may provide

Relevant knowledge for work and for learning is distributed in our head, in the heads of others, and in the environment. Learning webs are used by (virtual) communities of practice. Domain-oriented design environments (DODEs) support learning webs by allowing all stakeholders in a design process to learn and work collaboratively with each other and with their computational environments. DODEs serve as models for the design of collaborative working and learning environments by exploring and supporting different relationships and task responsibilities between humans and computers. DODEs integrate working and learning by grounding learning in self-directed, authentic activities. They support learning on demand as an essential element of life-long learning. The creation of DODEs faces the fundamental challenge to make them simultaneously learner-directed and supportive. DODEs transcend other computer-supported cooperative learning systems, which employ the computer only as a medium with few interpretable components. They integrate humans and computational resources more creatively by acknowledging that persons become skill resources only when they consent to do so, whereas computational environments are available at the bidding of the user.","Papers","human,mind,limited,making,collaboration,human,thing,case,computational,environment,necessity,rather,luxury,relevant,knowledge,work,learning,distributed,head,head,others,environment,learning,web,used,virtual,community,practice,domain-oriented,design,environment,dodes,support,learning,web,allowing,stakeholder,design,process,learn,work,collaboratively,computational,environment,dodes,serve,model,design,collaborative,working,learning,environment,exploring,supporting,different,relationship,task,responsibility,human,computer,dodes,integrate,working,learning,grounding,learning,self-directed,authentic,activity,support,learning,demand,essential,element,life-long,learning,creation,dodes,face,fundamental,challenge,make,simultaneously,learner-directed,supportive,dodes,transcend,computer-supported,cooperative,learning,system,employ,computer,medium,interpretable,component,integrate,human,computational,resource,creatively,acknowledging,person,become,skill,resource,consent,whereas,computational,environment,available,bidding,user","human

These systems do not yet approach the interaction richness of a face-toface learning situation. In particular, one element poorly supported is workspace awareness: the up-tothe-minute knowledge a student requires about other students' interactions with the shared workspace. This awareness is essential if students are to learn and work together effectively. We present a framework of several types of awareness required by students in a collaborative learning situation, including their social, task, concept and workspace awareness. We then concentrate on workspace awareness, and describe how particular awareness requirements of students in group learning situations depend on the closeness of their tasks, and whether they are sharing the same view or have separate views into the workspace. From these requirements, we have prototyped several awareness widgets for educational groupware. These widgets help learners maintain awareness of o ther learners' locations when their views are separated, of other learners' activities in shared and separate view situations, and of other learners' past activities.","Papers","real-time,educational,groupware,system,allow,physically,separated,learner,work,together,shared,virtual,workspace,time,system,yet,approach,interaction,richness,face-toface,learning,situation,particular,one,element,poorly,supported,workspace,awareness,up-tothe-minute,knowledge,student,requires,student,interaction,shared,workspace,awareness,essential,student,learn,work,together,effectively,present,framework,several,type,awareness,required,student,collaborative,learning,situation,including,social,task,concept,workspace,awareness,concentrate,workspace,awareness,describe,particular,awareness,requirement,student,group,learning,situation,depend,closeness,task,whether,sharing,view,separate,view,workspace,requirement,prototyped,several,awareness,widget,educational,groupware,widget,help,learner,maintain,awareness,ther,learner,location,view,separated,learner,activity,shared,separate,view,situation,learner,past,activity","real-time

Findings are derived from a three year ethnographic study of an international, 400 member group of academics who communicated with each other using ListServer technology on ten, subsequently five electronic mailing lists. Using Soviet Activity Theory and a Conversation for Action discursive model of communication to make sense of the flow of on-line communication, three recurrent patterns of communicative activity were identified as constitutive, though irreducible, to what was termed electronic academia. These patterns of communication were referred to as academic, administrative and community-building action, one of which is succinctly illustrated and discussed here. Characteristic features of community-buildingdiscourse selectively included here are naming the community; and civil language uses (i.e. warm and playful; grateful and positive uses). Functions of community-building action briefly presented are growth and continuity. Together, mediating functions and features of community-building are seen as foundation for productivity and conceptual

Designing sustainably engineered solutions requires weighing the qualities of different proposals from a variety of different perspectives and handling a variety of tradeoffs simultaneously. Of necessity, these problems must be solved in multidisciplinary groups. Students, therefore, need to learn not only what their own disciplines have to say about the issues, but they also need to be able to recognize other issues that arise and to know which disciplines can contribute to their solutions. Thus, students need to learn how to recognize new issues and to work collaboratively. One possible solution is for students to learn by working on cases in multidisciplinary teams These multidisciplinary groups provide opportunities for collaboration and reflection that have the potential to greatly enhance student learning. Technology plays an important role in supporting such collaboration and reflection. In particular, this curriculum makes use of the Collaborative and Multimedia Interactive Learning Environment (CaMILE) to scaffold collaboration and reflection.","Papers","sustainable,technology,defined,technology,provides,current,need,without,sacrificing,ability,future,population,sustain,designing,sustainably,engineered,solution,requires,weighing,quality,different,proposal,variety,different,perspective,handling,variety,tradeoff,simultaneously,necessity,problem,must,solved,multidisciplinary,group,student,therefore,need,learn,discipline,say,issue,also,need,able,recognize,issue,arise,know,discipline,contribute,solution,thus,student,need,learn,recognize,new,issue,work,collaboratively,one,possible,solution,student,learn,working,case,multidisciplinary,team,multidisciplinary,group,provide,opportunity,collaboration,reflection,potential,greatly,enhance,student,learning,technology,play,important,role,supporting,collaboration,reflection,particular,curriculum,make,use,collaborative,multimedia,interactive,learning,environment,camile,scaffold,collaboration,reflection","sustainable

In this paper we will focus on crucial aspects of cooperative interaction in problem-solving learning situations, which we found hard to implement in our system.

The purpose is to develop the ability to think algorithmically and the ability to view things systematically. It is a simulation game of sumo wrestling - the traditional Japanese national sport. Students are supposed to program the actions of their own wrestler using a programming language so as 'to win matches against other wrestlers. To make the wrestler stronger, students are encouraged to analyze the chaotic situation systematically, devise better tactics, and incorporate them into the program. Such comprehensive problemsolving activities are comparable to the processes involved in software design. In addition, students commit to solving their own problems at their own responsibility. It is also comparable to the authentic activities of a software designer. In this sense, activities with AlgoArena can be regarded as a significant 'epitome' of authentic software design. Social setting for the learning environment is attributable to constraints embedded in the system of AlgoArena. For example, owing to the constraint of the game that a player needs opponents to fight with, students are encouraged to have matches with others, and social interaction among students is facilitated. In this way, a game situation is brought into the context of learning and produces a community of learners.","Papers","algoarena,tool,education,software,design,beginner,purpose,develop,ability,think,algorithmically,ability,view,thing,systematically,simulation,game,sumo,wrestling,traditional,japanese,national,sport,student,supposed,program,action,wrestler,using,programming,language,'to,win,match,wrestler,make,wrestler,stronger,student,encouraged,analyze,chaotic,situation,systematically,devise,better,tactic,incorporate,program,comprehensive,problemsolving,activity,comparable,process,involved,software,design,addition,student,commit,solving,problem,responsibility,also,comparable,authentic,activity,software,designer,sense,activity,algoarena,regarded,significant,'epitome,authentic,software,design,social,setting,learning,environment,attributable,constraint,embedded,system,algoarena,example,owing,constraint,game,player,need,opponent,fight,student,encouraged,match,others,social,interaction,among,student,facilitated,way,game,situation,brought,context,learning,produce,community,learner","algoarena

The authors form one of the pairings (computer scientist, elementary teacher) of university researchers with teachers, in the E-GEMS classroom study, an ongoing long-term qualitative study on the potential uses of electronic games and activities for enhancing mathematics learning in intermediate grade classrooms. We believe the experiences from this study can provide insight on issues of importance to research on computer-supported collaborative learning in the classroom and to mathematics education. Our experiences echo those of many others on the effectiveness of collaborative use of computers, where the collaboration occurs through small groups of learners working at each computer. We also note the positive impact of connecting the computer activities with related large and small group classroom activities. We are excited by the success of these approaches in stimulating students to talk and write about mathematical concepts, and to view themselves as researchers exploring mathematical ideas. Finally, our experiences reinforce the need to re-examine user-interfaces and other areas in human-computer interaction in the context of computer-supported learning.

Initial findings indicate that the CASENET tools and resources establish conditions for mutually beneficial professional conversations that encourage participation in a professional community. Such participation has been shown to support teachers as they attempt to change practice and implement reform. Six veteran social studies teachers and six student teachers engaged in discussions of teaching strategies and garnered mutual support for the risk-taking inherent in change. The multimedia cases provided a common context for discussion and the videoconference allowed for personalized, non-threatening contacts among teachers at vastly different stages in their careers, but faced with similar challenges.

This vision stems from a novel and evolving approach to collaborative learning that we are developing at the EduTech Institute. This approach is based on the following premises: that learning is facilitated by generative problem solving, collaborative work and use of multiple cases; that learning and skill acquisition need to be, and can be, scaffolded through software; and that a computer environment which integrates a shared and structured electronic workspace with a full variety of functionalities can effectively support all of the above. We describe this approach and the architecture of the corresponding computer environment. This environment is designed to serve three critical functions: provide a shared workspace for students, facilitate inter- and intra-group collaborative work, and make available the tools and resources that students need for problem solving and learning. The software components of the environment that have already been implemented are described. In the final section we frame ongoing and planned research and development efforts in terms of the characteristics desired of such an environment and ways of assessing its impact.","Papers","paper,present,vision,computer-supported,collaborative,learning,solving,generative,problem,problem,promote,open-ended,inquiry,multiple,solution,vision,stem,novel,evolving,approach,collaborative,learning,developing,edutech,institute,approach,based,following,premise,learning,facilitated,generative,problem,solving,collaborative,work,use,multiple,case,learning,skill,acquisition,need,scaffolded,software,computer,environment,integrates,shared,structured,electronic,workspace,full,variety,functionality,effectively,support,describe,approach,architecture,corresponding,computer,environment,environment,designed,serve,three,critical,function,provide,shared,workspace,student,facilitate,inter-,intra-group,collaborative,work,make,available,tool,resource,student,need,problem,solving,learning,software,component,environment,already,implemented,described,final,section,frame,ongoing,planned,research,development,effort,term,characteristic,desired,environment,way,assessing,impact","paper

Second, it is considered to be bottom-up in the sense that its aim was to engage students in activities that were consistent with their provisional ways of knowing.

Computers are useful in collaborative writing because repeated use of tutorials can help students learn problem-solving methods, allow students to share their work in a flexible manner suited to many classroom environments (K12 and college), and serve to give teachers a window into the thinking process of their students. The SEENMath software, developed through a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant, comes with a tutorial in mathematical problem-solving (based on Polya's four-step heuristic) that allows students to accompany their writing with drawings, calculations or graphs. Students share their completed explorations of a problem with other students through a built-in bulletin board that allows peer review. Use of the software at Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis (IUPUI) with large sections of Finite Mathematics shows the practicality of including collaboration as homework (for

The approach was predicated on the assumption that students authentically construct knowledge from their experiences within a social context of peer influence. Reflective writing in the context of a public forum in which students were required to react to each other's writing engaged students in a process of critical thinking. They were required to maintain an electronic journal which consisted of weekly narratives (postings to a ""netnews group"") which consisted of reflections on classroom activities and related readings. Classroom activities included the use of a writing activity described as a Dyadic Essay Confrontation (DEC). Students were required to react to a randomly determined partner's reflections within one week after the initial reflection. A final narrative reflection was required to be submitted to the newsgroup detailing a summary analysis of the constructed knowledge they had determined was brought about through this process. Their reflections and reactions and summary/conclusions comprised a major product for inclusion in an electronic portfolio which was submitted at the end of the class. The techniques, as well as how this complex structure was implemented, and, how students responded· to the electronic medium are discussed. Using a rationale derived from the WAC community that stresses integration of the writing process across the curriculum, the conclusions focus on using CMC as an integral part of classroom instruction. A Postmodern and Constructivist theoretical orientation is used to explain the positive student responses to this complex of authentic instruction.","Papers","student,reactions/evaluations,associated,diverse,pedagogical,structure,including,cooperative,learning,cl,computer,mediated,communication,cmc,writing,across,curriculum,wac,used,deliver,graduate,instruction,educational,psychology,course,approach,predicated,assumption,student,authentically,construct,knowledge,experience,within,social,context,peer,influence,reflective,writing,context,public,forum,student,required,react,'s,writing,engaged,student,process,critical,thinking,required,maintain,electronic,journal,consisted,weekly,narrative,posting,``,netnews,group,'',consisted,reflection,classroom,activity,related,reading,classroom,activity,included,use,writing,activity,described,dyadic,essay,confrontation,dec,student,required,react,randomly,determined,partner,'s,reflection,within,one,week,initial,reflection,final,narrative,reflection,required,submitted,newsgroup,detailing,summary,analysis,constructed,knowledge,determined,brought,process,reflection,reaction,summary/conclusions,comprised,major,product,inclusion,electronic,portfolio,submitted,end,class,technique,well,complex,structure,implemented,student,responded·,electronic,medium,discussed,using,rationale,derived,wac,community,stress,integration,writing,process,across,curriculum,conclusion,focus,using,cmc,integral,part,classroom,instruction,postmodern,constructivist,theoretical,orientation,used,explain,positive,student,response,complex,authentic,instruction","student

Emphasis is placed on blending synchronous and asynchronous technologies to facilitate sustained interaction and real-time application of concepts. Options contained within INSTRUCT include a hypermedia version of the Professional Standards for Classroom Teaching, links for connecting to on-line educational resources, the ability to attend synchronous meetings with other INSTRUCT users, opportunities to join in asynchronous discussions, and general access to the Internet. Three key research questions concerning this type of technology are discussed: The amount of face-to-face training required for teachers to become comfortable using INSTRUCT, the extent to which collaboration features of INSTRUCT must be formalized to ensure involvement by participants, and whether use of INSTRUCT can foster among teachers a sense of self-worth and community resulting in lasting change in practice.","Papers","paper,suggests,possible,application,world,wide,web,distance,teacher,training,area,mathematics,education,instruct,implementing,nctm,school,teaching,recommendation,using,collaborative,telecommunication,designed,introduce,secondary,mathematics,instructor,professional,standard,teaching,mathematics,nctm,1991,fostering,sense,community,among,teacher,physically,removed,emphasis,placed,blending,synchronous,asynchronous,technology,facilitate,sustained,interaction,real-time,application,concept,option,contained,within,instruct,include,hypermedia,version,professional,standard,classroom,teaching,link,connecting,on-line,educational,resource,ability,attend,synchronous,meeting,instruct,user,opportunity,join,asynchronous,discussion,general,access,internet,three,key,research,question,concerning,type,technology,discussed,amount,face-to-face,training,required,teacher,become,comfortable,using,instruct,extent,collaboration,feature,instruct,must,formalized,ensure,involvement,participant,whether,use,instruct,foster,among,teacher,sense,self-worth,community,resulting,lasting,change,practice","paper

Based on models of situated cognition and learning and research findings on vocabulary knowledge and learning, the importance of contextual information (including situational meanings and actual usage in discourse community) and hypertextual presentation of such information is emphasized. Two projects implementing this framework are described. The Language Mediation Assistant is a hypertextual system designed to help novice participants or those with limited language abilities to become involved in network-based projects. It provides contextual meanings and actual message texts from the projects hypertextually to help learners understand the meanings and usage of words in particular domains or in particular communities. Impact! Online is a project to provide ESL learners with an integrated language learning environment for reading, writing and vocabulary. News articles with hypertextual vocabulary aid and a mailing list for discussions on news topics are the core of this project. In these two projects, it has been observed that the framework of hypertextual situational support for vocabulary understanding is useful in computer networkbased learning activities, especially with students using foreign language in communication.","Papers","article,proposes,framework,designing,support,system,enhance,communication,collaborative,learning,activity,using,computer,network,based,model,situated,cognition,learning,research,finding,vocabulary,knowledge,learning,importance,contextual,information,including,situational,meaning,actual,usage,discourse,community,hypertextual,presentation,information,emphasized,two,project,implementing,framework,described,language,mediation,assistant,hypertextual,system,designed,help,novice,participant,limited,language,ability,become,involved,network-based,project,provides,contextual,meaning,actual,message,text,project,hypertextually,help,learner,understand,meaning,usage,word,particular,domain,particular,community,impact,online,project,provide,esl,learner,integrated,language,learning,environment,reading,writing,vocabulary,news,article,hypertextual,vocabulary,aid,mailing,list,discussion,news,topic,core,project,two,project,observed,framework,hypertextual,situational,support,vocabulary,understanding,useful,computer,networkbased,learning,activity,especially,student,using,foreign,language,communication","article

The authors propose, as one possibility, the role of computer-based educational tools as supporters of a ""community of learners"". ""Community of learners"" is a community maintained by ""learners"" who are trying to establish their identities in a certain community of practice. It works as an interface to full participation in the community of practice. Both facilitating interactions among learners and making links between activities within the community of learners and practices in the real world are crucial for supporting the community of learners. As the first step to this goal, the authors focus on interaction-level support of the community of learners, and mention AlgoBlock, a tangible programming language developed by the authors, as an example of computer-based educational tools for facilitating interactions among learners.","Papers","paper,role,computer-based,educational,tool,discussed,standpoint,situated,learning,theory,e.g.,brown,et,al,1988,lave,et,al,1991,considers,learning,process,enculturation,community,practice,lave,et,al,1991,author,propose,one,possibility,role,computer-based,educational,tool,supporter,``,community,learner,'',``,community,learner,'',community,maintained,``,learner,'',trying,establish,identity,certain,community,practice,work,interface,full,participation,community,practice,facilitating,interaction,among,learner,making,link,activity,within,community,learner,practice,real,world,crucial,supporting,community,learner,first,step,goal,author,focus,interaction-level,support,community,learner,mention,algoblock,tangible,programming,language,developed,author,example,computer-based,educational,tool,facilitating,interaction,among,learner","paper

Once the domain of technical experts and ""guru's, we are now told that computers are ""for the rest of us""[4]. However, usable software designs still mandate some specialized training in their use [3]. As computers become more prevalent in the workplace, individuals must both maintain their current level of productivity while learning new methods of performing tasks tey had previously done either manually or using a different computer software application. Software that minimizes learning time could be of substantial value to deadline pressured workers who must take advantage of advancing technologies but do not have access to special training. DesiL (Designing for Learnability) is a methodology for informing the design of microcomputer software, that may permit a designer to produce both usable and more easily learned software applications. This methodology is non-deterministic in that it does not make decisions for a designer, but rather informs a designer's options toward creating software that may be more easily learned by the end

The present study analysed the strategies and interactions of 30 pairs of children (mean age 7 years 3 months) in relation to three sets of tasks. The children worked with the screen version of Logo (LCSI) in tasks that required them to make accurate copies of given (Logo) figures and to direct the turtle up a path to a destination The results revealed that when the copy task was presented first and followed by the track task there were no significant differences in performance in terms of accuracy or efficiency of moves made in order to reach the end of the path. This was a contrast to previous findings when the track task had been presented first. The current research illustrated that performance was moderated by the type of strategies that were deployed and the nature of the collaboration of the pairs.","Papers","present,study,represented,final,series,five,explored,performance,child,logo,task,worked,one,three,gender,pair,girl,boy,boy/,girl,difference,performance,based,gender,pair,apparent,early,study,specific,type,task,presented,initial,experience,new,domain,present,study,analysed,strategy,interaction,30,pair,child,mean,age,7,year,3,month,relation,three,set,task,child,worked,screen,version,logo,lcsi,task,required,make,accurate,copy,given,logo,figure,direct,turtle,path,destination,result,revealed,copy,task,presented,first,followed,track,task,significant,difference,performance,term,accuracy,efficiency,move,made,order,reach,end,path,contrast,previous,finding,track,task,presented,first,current,research,illustrated,performance,moderated,type,strategy,deployed,nature,collaboration,pair","present study,study represented,represented final,final series,series five,five explored,explored performance,performance child,child logo,logo task,task worked,worked one,one three,three gender,gender pair,pair girl,girl boy,boy boy/,boy/ girl,girl difference,difference performance,performance based,based gender,gender pair,pair apparent,apparent early,early study,study specific,specific type,type task,task presented,presented initial,initial experience,experience new,new domain,domain present,present study,study analysed,analysed strategy,strategy interaction,interaction 30,30 pair,pair child,child mean,mean age,age 7,7 year,year 3,3 month,month relation,relation three,three set,set task,task child,child worked,worked screen,screen version,version logo,logo lcsi,lcsi task,task required,required make,make accurate,accurate copy,copy given,given logo,logo figure,figure direct,direct turtle,turtle path,path destination,destination result,result revealed,revealed copy,copy task,task presented,presented first,first followed,followed track,track task,task significant,significant difference,difference performance,performance term,term accuracy,accuracy efficiency,efficiency move,move made,made order,order reach,reach end,end path,path contrast,contrast previous,previous finding,finding track,track task,task presented,presented first,first current,current research,research illustrated,illustrated performance,performance moderated,moderated type,type strategy,strategy deployed,deployed nature,nature collaboration,collaboration pair","present study represented,study represented final,represented final series,final series five,series five explored,five explored performance,explored performance child,performance child logo,child logo task,logo task worked,task worked one,worked one three,one three gender,three gender pair,gender pair girl,pair girl boy,girl boy boy/,boy boy/ girl,boy/ girl difference,girl difference performance,difference performance based,performance based gender,based gender pair,gender pair apparent,pair apparent early,apparent early study,early study specific,study specific type,specific type task,type task presented,task presented initial,presented initial experience,initial experience new,experience new domain,new domain present,domain present study,present study analysed,study analysed strategy,analysed strategy interaction,strategy interaction 30,interaction 30 pair,30 pair child,pair child mean,child mean age,mean age 7,age 7 year,7 year 3,year 3 month,3 month relation,month relation three,relation three set,three set task,set task child,task child worked,child worked screen,worked screen version,screen version logo,version logo lcsi,logo lcsi task,lcsi task required,task required make,required make accurate,make accurate copy,accurate copy given,copy given logo,given logo figure,logo figure direct,figure direct turtle,direct turtle path,turtle path destination,path destination result,destination result revealed,result revealed copy,revealed copy task,copy task presented,task presented first,presented first followed,first followed track,followed track task,track task significant,task significant difference,significant difference performance,difference performance term,performance term accuracy,term accuracy efficiency,accuracy efficiency move,efficiency move made,move made order,made order reach,order reach end,reach end path,end path contrast,path contrast previous,contrast previous finding,previous finding track,finding track task,track task presented,task presented first,presented first current,first current research,current research illustrated,research illustrated performance,illustrated performance moderated,performance moderated type,moderated type strategy,type strategy deployed,strategy deployed nature,deployed nature collaboration,nature collaboration pair"

This approach ""anchors"" instruction in the context of meaningful problem solving environments, engaging both teachers and students in sustained exploration of a rich problem space [3]. Anchored instruction requires reevaluating classroom structure, communication dynamics, and the instructional artifacts used in the process. A major challenge for anchored instruction, and problem based learning curricula in general, is to help ensure that each student learns while also gaining the experience of working collaboratively. One possible solution involves integrating the computer as an active ""agent"" involved in the instructional process.

that employs this framework for use with students in a collaborative

During reciprocal tutoring, two agents, where an agent is either a real student or a virtual learning companion simulated by the computer, interact and take turns for playing the roles of a tutor and a tutee.

Collaborative learning is gaining in popularity but we still need to establish what is meant by it and gain insight into its process. This paper proposes an innovative analytical framework for viewing the collaborative process. It reports on a study with elementary school aged children working with LEGO/Logo and their evolving understanding of the scientific concept of mechanical advantage. It comes as little surprise that children learning collaboratively is not always as collaborative as one might have expected. In fact, in this study disagreements arose frequently. Some of the findings are reported and support the view that disagreements can be a legitimate form of collaboration.","Papers","recognition,importance,social,role,learning,combined,advancement,educational,application,computer,technology,sparked,development,innovative,learning,situation,resulting,increased,complexity,social,context,learning,occurring,requires,indepth,understanding,learning,process,collaborative,learning,gaining,popularity,still,need,establish,meant,gain,insight,process,paper,proposes,innovative,analytical,framework,viewing,collaborative,process,report,study,elementary,school,aged,child,working,lego/logo,evolving,understanding,scientific,concept,mechanical,advantage,come,little,surprise,child,learning,collaboratively,always,collaborative,one,might,expected,fact,study,disagreement,arose,frequently,finding,reported,support,view,disagreement,legitimate,form,collaboration","recognition importance,importance social,social role,role learning,learning combined,combined advancement,advancement educational,educational application,application computer,computer technology,technology sparked,sparked development,development innovative,innovative learning,learning situation,situation resulting,resulting increased,increased complexity,complexity social,social context,context learning,learning occurring,occurring requires,requires indepth,indepth understanding,understanding learning,learning process,process collaborative,collaborative learning,learning gaining,gaining popularity,popularity still,still need,need establish,establish meant,meant gain,gain insight,insight process,process paper,paper proposes,proposes innovative,innovative analytical,analytical framework,framework viewing,viewing collaborative,collaborative process,process report,report study,study elementary,elementary school,school aged,aged child,child working,working lego/logo,lego/logo evolving,evolving understanding,understanding scientific,scientific concept,concept mechanical,mechanical advantage,advantage come,come little,little surprise,surprise child,child learning,learning collaboratively,collaboratively always,always collaborative,collaborative one,one might,might expected,expected fact,fact study,study disagreement,disagreement arose,arose frequently,frequently finding,finding reported,reported support,support view,view disagreement,disagreement legitimate,legitimate form,form collaboration","recognition importance social,importance social role,social role learning,role learning combined,learning combined advancement,combined advancement educational,advancement educational application,educational application computer,application computer technology,computer technology sparked,technology sparked development,sparked development innovative,development innovative learning,innovative learning situation,learning situation resulting,situation resulting increased,resulting increased complexity,increased complexity social,complexity social context,social context learning,context learning occurring,learning occurring requires,occurring requires indepth,requires indepth understanding,indepth understanding learning,understanding learning process,learning process collaborative,process collaborative learning,collaborative learning gaining,learning gaining popularity,gaining popularity still,popularity still need,still need establish,need establish meant,establish meant gain,meant gain insight,gain insight process,insight process paper,process paper proposes,paper proposes innovative,proposes innovative analytical,innovative analytical framework,analytical framework viewing,framework viewing collaborative,viewing collaborative process,collaborative process report,process report study,report study elementary,study elementary school,elementary school aged,school aged child,aged child working,child working lego/logo,working lego/logo evolving,lego/logo evolving understanding,evolving understanding scientific,understanding scientific concept,scientific concept mechanical,concept mechanical advantage,mechanical advantage come,advantage come little,come little surprise,little surprise child,surprise child learning,child learning collaboratively,learning collaboratively always,collaboratively always collaborative,always collaborative one,collaborative one might,one might expected,might expected fact,expected fact study,fact study disagreement,study disagreement arose,disagreement arose frequently,arose frequently finding,frequently finding reported,finding reported support,reported support view,support view disagreement,view disagreement legitimate,disagreement legitimate form,legitimate form collaboration"

We suggest that computer systems should be designed to support collaborative learnability; to this end, we offer a number of collaborative learnability design principles. In particular, we emphasize that the prime objective should be user participation. We suggest some principles of collaborative visibility and highlight the importance of the demonstration in the sharing of skills. The various design principles are incorporated into a generic model for collaborative user support called MutualAid. A specific system based on this model is also described. This system uses multimedia demonstrations recorded by end users to support an interactive problem-solving forum and the development of a local database of computer-related practice.","Papers","paper,considers,computer-based,support,development,computer,skill,workplace,suggest,computer,system,designed,support,collaborative,learnability,end,offer,number,collaborative,learnability,design,principle,particular,emphasize,prime,objective,user,participation,suggest,principle,collaborative,visibility,highlight,importance,demonstration,sharing,skill,various,design,principle,incorporated,generic,model,collaborative,user,support,called,mutualaid,specific,system,based,model,also,described,system,us,multimedia,demonstration,recorded,end,user,support,interactive,problem-solving,forum,development,local,database,computer-related,practice","paper considers,considers computer-based,computer-based support,support development,development computer,computer skill,skill workplace,workplace suggest,suggest computer,computer system,system designed,designed support,support collaborative,collaborative learnability,learnability end,end offer,offer number,number collaborative,collaborative learnability,learnability design,design principle,principle particular,particular emphasize,emphasize prime,prime objective,objective user,user participation,participation suggest,suggest principle,principle collaborative,collaborative visibility,visibility highlight,highlight importance,importance demonstration,demonstration sharing,sharing skill,skill various,various design,design principle,principle incorporated,incorporated generic,generic model,model collaborative,collaborative user,user support,support called,called mutualaid,mutualaid specific,specific system,system based,based model,model also,also described,described system,system us,us multimedia,multimedia demonstration,demonstration recorded,recorded end,end user,user support,support interactive,interactive problem-solving,problem-solving forum,forum development,development local,local database,database computer-related,computer-related practice","paper considers computer-based,considers computer-based support,computer-based support development,support development computer,development computer skill,computer skill workplace,skill workplace suggest,workplace suggest computer,suggest computer system,computer system designed,system designed support,designed support collaborative,support collaborative learnability,collaborative learnability end,learnability end offer,end offer number,offer number collaborative,number collaborative learnability,collaborative learnability design,learnability design principle,design principle particular,principle particular emphasize,particular emphasize prime,emphasize prime objective,prime objective user,objective user participation,user participation suggest,participation suggest principle,suggest principle collaborative,principle collaborative visibility,collaborative visibility highlight,visibility highlight importance,highlight importance demonstration,importance demonstration sharing,demonstration sharing skill,sharing skill various,skill various design,various design principle,design principle incorporated,principle incorporated generic,incorporated generic model,generic model collaborative,model collaborative user,collaborative user support,user support called,support called mutualaid,called mutualaid specific,mutualaid specific system,specific system based,system based model,based model also,model also described,also described system,described system us,system us multimedia,us multimedia demonstration,multimedia demonstration recorded,demonstration recorded end,recorded end user,end user support,user support interactive,support interactive problem-solving,interactive problem-solving forum,problem-solving forum development,forum development local,development local database,local database computer-related,database computer-related practice"
