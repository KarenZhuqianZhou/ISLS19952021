The paper presents findings of one video extract from ten months of observation of single-touch screen interaction among 8-9 year-old children. Recent studies of collaborative learning mediated by digital touch screens and tabletops emphasize the possibilities for equal levels of verbal and physical participation. Additionally, these studies suggest that multi-touch technologies offer more task-oriented activities compared to single-touch screen interaction, in which discussion about turn-taking is more prevalent from the outset. In contrast, applying the Embodied Interaction Analysis, we find that the constraints of single-touch screens offer support for intersubjective meaning making in their capacity of constraining the interaction. This ""grain of sand"" shows how children display and construct a shared work space through embodied interaction with a single-touch screen.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:43Z (GMT).

In this paper, we evaluate one such conversational agent-as-facilitator design, drawn from the literature on what has been termed Academically Productive Talk. Specifically we evaluate the effect of a facilitation strategy referred to as Agree/Disagree, where students are prompted to evaluate the assertions of a partner student. In a simple two condition study, we evaluate the effect of this facilitation strategy in comparison with an otherwise identical condition where this facilitation strategy is absent. The results demonstrate a marginal positive effect on learning (effect size .55 standard deviations) and a significant intensification effect on the collaborative discourse.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:44Z (GMT).

Students use the Idea Manager to track ideas as they encounter new information, and reflect upon, sort, and distinguish ideas toward integrating their understanding. To explore the value of collaborative features, we designed a hybrid online/offline activity to facilitate students exchanging ideas with the Idea Manager. Based on student interviews and case studies, we identify aspects of collaboration to inform design features for enabling the meaningful exchange of ideas. Whereas most design accounts focus on the evaluative role of prototyping, this study highlights its reflective use, and its role in involving multiple stakeholders in rapid iterative cycles of establishing requirements, building alternatives, and testing. By documenting these iterative design activities, this study informs both the theory and practice of designing collaborative educational technologies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:44Z (GMT).

This paper reports quasi-experimental research conducted in a higher education nutrition science classroom in Fall 09 and Spring 12. Students participated in a multimedia creation project as an integral part of the course, whereby they collaborated in small groups to create video PSAs about a topic of choice. In order to develop this project, students underwent digital research and multimedia training sessions. They answered pre and posttest surveys about their attitudes and self-reported abilities with reference to digital literacy and multimedia skills, and participated in focus group interviews to discuss their experiences in detail. Survey results show an improvement in their understanding of copyright information and multimedia skills, and focus group interviews underscore the many enjoyable and frustrating aspects of the process. Pedagogical implications are discussed. Introduction Student-created video projects involving collecting and presenting video data or telling a scripted story using original footage, music, graphics, animations, etc. have often been studied for their pedagogical abilities. For instance, middle school students in Egypt were taught to use Microsoft Photo Story to create videos related to any topic of their choice (Sadik, 2008), 10 year old English children were taught to use digital editing software and they created stories related to their school (Pearson, 2005) or college student made podcasts on topics related to Information Technology (Lee, McLoughlin and Chan, 2008). However, the use of digital video in education is woefully under researched, particularly that which is integrated within the established or mainstream curricula (Pearson, 2005 and Lippincott, 2007). A quick review of literature shows that there's a paucity of research about the use of this tool for scholarly storytelling, i.e. explaining existing research about a specific topic using original footage, music, graphics, animations, etc. The primary examples of such creations are commercially produced videos, documentaries or digital shorts, but those produced by students are rarely discussed in the literature. For instance, Nixon (2009) describes a digital storytelling project of bilingual high school students where including data was a personal choice, the project was extra-mural and Nixon does not explain if and how students were trained to use the tools of digital and multimedia literacy- something of crucial importance to multimedia creation in education (Lippincott, 2007). In this paper, we discuss a collaborative scholarly storytelling project about nutrition science in a higher education classroom, along with the process by which we prepared students to take on the challenge of translating scientific research into an accessible video PSA. Student groups in Nutrition 360 are required to create a video PSA on any topic related to nutrition for which they shoot original footage and edit it digitally. A unique inter-institutional collaboration between the instructor, the university's media and technology support unit, and the university libraries sustains this project. The goal is to facilitate students' digital scholarly storytelling i.e. research that is translated and visualized in an accessible manner in the form of a video. The project was studied in Fall 09 and Spring 12. Student feedback in the first iteration drove changes on several counts, discussed in detail later. We were curious about how the digital and library research and multimedia training affected students' perceived abilities and attitudes in every iteration, and what the differences between iterations were, if any. Hence, the research questions for our study were as follows: i) How does library training affect students' perceived abilities and attitudes toward finding and using digital library resources or other online information sources for class assignments? ii) How does multimedia training affect students' perceived abilities and attitudes toward creating multimedia for class assignments? iii) How do changes between two semesters affect a) Students' perceived abilities and attitudes toward finding and using digital library resources or other online information sources for class assignments? b) Students' perceived abilities and attitudes toward creating multimedia for class assignments? iv) How do changes between two semesters affect students' experience of learning to, and designing and developing the project? Data for this study relied on two instances of training: the library training session covered the library's website as well as other online research sources and the multimedia training session covered using iMovie, the","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:45Z (GMT).

More specifically, the study argues that modern virtual manipulatives should offer a rich sensory experience by presenting information visually, aurally, and kinesthetically and that carefully designed perceptual experiences will facilitate learning in young children. To test this hypothesis, sixty (N = 60) second grade students were randomly assigned to learn multiplication using software designed to vary the aural and kinesthetic experience while holding the visual presentation constant. The results reveal that both aural and kinesthetic interactions increased learning outcomes but in different ways and at different points. The paper concludes with a full discussion of the results as well as their theoretical and practical implications.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:46Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We examine the forms of these collective representations with a view towards understanding their efficacy in scaffolding learners and resolving their driving inquiry questions. We analyze the patterns of discourse and of use surrounding these aggregate visualizations during teacher-led, whole class discussions.

In the socio-cultural approach the concept of collective knowledge is central. The Co-Evolution Model of Individual Learning and Collaborative Knowledge Building (Cress &amp; Kimmerle, 2008; Moskaliuk, Kimmerle &amp; Cress, 2009, 2012) combines both approaches and considers internal-individual and external- collaborative processes that take place when people work on a shared artifact. We apply this framework to social tagging and explain how tag clouds represent collective knowledge. Referring to the Information Foraging Theory (Pirolli, 2007; Pirolli &amp; Card, 1999) we show how people make use of collective knowledge when navigating with tag clouds. We give an overview of several experimental studies that induce situations where individual and collective knowledge contradict each other. The results show that in such situations incidental learning takes place, and users' individual conceptual knowledge assimilates to the collective conceptual knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:48Z (GMT).

We distinguish problems of gameplay from problems of divergence between game and non-game logics. Using Bguin &amp; Rabardel's theory of instrumental genesis we observe how the gamification instrument shapes the review activity, in the process of continuously adapting artifacts and users' activity schemes. We identify locally emergent solutions to the divergence issue: players resort to half-engagement with the game and tailor gameplay strategies, selectively ignoring, observing or bending rules such as to manage the relative priorities of game and non-game objectives. In our case study gamification is more than an engine for fun: it facilitates learning by structuring the collaborative activity in memorable events with specific tempo, attention focus, and communication style. Constant adjustment enriches learning and becomes part of the game.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:48Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

From the start, we designed TapaCarp for a classroom usage. This led to an interface distributed over several components and modalities. A first user study conducted in a classroom environment and involving 24 carpenter apprentices produced mixed conclusions about the distribution of the interface. On one hand, it proved suitable in terms of classroom integration and flexibility. On the other hand, it hurt usability, both at the group level and at the classroom level. Based on these results, we discuss the relevance of distributing a learning environment interface and introduce the concept of ""over-Hutchins threshold"", a point after which the distribution of the interface becomes harmful to classroom orchestration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:48Z (GMT).

A total of six sections, each with approximately 20 students enrolled, of an educational technology course at a large research university in the United States participated in the study.

We propose a cohesion-based analysis model integrating multiple natural language techniques, an intervention scoring mechanism and a comprehensive collaboration assessment method, derived from social knowledge- building, reflected at utterance level through cohesion. Furthermore, by combining a holistic perspective of the entire conversation with a more fine grained view focused on each participant, we obtain a thorough evaluation of chat conversations with focus on topics modeling, participant interaction and collaboration. In order to sustain our model, we have performed a preliminary validation study that proves that our analysis is consistent with tutor evaluations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:50Z (GMT).

Differently coded representations, interactive components, and communication have to be managed and processed simultaneously. Focusing learners' attention to relevant information might help to reduce complexity. This study was designed to investigate whether collaborative learning with multimedia can be improved by information cueing, i.e. highlighting essential information in differently coded learning material, and by providing relevant causal relations in interactive learning material. Learning dyads were compared in four experimental groups which differed with regard to information cueing during two subsequent collaboration phases. Learning material comprised multiple static representations (phase 1) and the possibility to manipulate these representations interactively (phase 2). Preliminary results (N = 24) indicate that cueing relevant information during collaboration focuses learners' attention to essential aspects, helps to structure their learning discourse, and improves learning outcome.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:50Z (GMT).

One cause could be a disconnection between genotype and phenotype level ideas. Making these connections explicit might help students build a more coherent understanding of evolution. This study investigates how a novel form of collaborative technology-enhanced concept map, called Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), can support students' learning from an inquiry-based, technology-enhanced evolution curriculum. Findings indicate that KIM activities can facilitate the generation of cross-connections between genotype and phenotype ideas and support students distinguishing central ideas. Results suggest that students' used fewer non-normative teleological ideas. Furthermore, results suggest that critiquing KIMs might be a more time-efficient alternative to generating KIMs from scratch. Findings from this study are valuable for the design of efficient learning environments to support more integrated understanding of complex scientific ideas.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:50Z (GMT).

We find that children negotiate their interaction with the exhibit in a variety of ways including reactive, articulated, and contemplated exploration. These strategies in turn influence the ways in which children make meaning through their experiences.

Analyses of how students interact or their contribution styles can help us understand weaknesses or strengths of the participants. This paper presents a framework for capturing information trading behaviors in Q&amp;A discussions using a `reciprocity' model. We measure the reciprocity of a student based on (a) the degree of responses that he/she received from other students in discussing his/her questions and (b) the degree of contributions in discussing other students' problems. We use a linear regression to model the overall reciprocity rate over time, and correlate the regression coefficient of the reciprocity rate to the student course grade. We found that although the overall reciprocity rate is not statistically correlated to the grade, high performing students have larger reciprocity rates and help other students more actively. We expect that the reciprocity rates revealed from discussion participations can help instructors make online activities more balanced.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:51Z (GMT).

Argunaut encapsulates many layers of ideas about dialogue and bears potential for dialogic education. In this paper, the intermittent use of Argunaut over a yearlong philosophy course is described. We focus on the trajectories of participation of two students. Two discursive phenomena are discussed: the transformation of a student, as a consequence of participation in a different group discussion, into a carrier of discursive norms previously unknown to its original peers; and the move into a multi-registered, double-voiced performance by another student. The role of the peers in these transformations is elaborated. The role of the tool Argunaut which was designed to support dialogic argumentation is also considered.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:51Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Our extension provides: (i) synchronous collaborative support to any lab developed with EJS (i.e., existing labs written in EJS can be automatically converted into collaborative with no cost), and (ii) support to deploy synchronous collaborative labs into Moodle. Thanks to our approach, students and/or teachers can invite other users enrolled in a Moodle course to a real-time collaborative experimental session, sharing and/or supervising experiences at the same time they practice and explore experiments using labs. The experimental evaluation of our work shows statistical significant (i) increase in student engagement and (ii) higher exam grades for students trained with collaborative labs.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:51Z (GMT).

Specifically, we examine how students leverage on knowledge resources and the physical affordances of the outdoor learning environment, to pursue their line of inquiries. Adapting Fischer and Mandl's (2005) coding scheme for the content dimension, we coded two groups' discourse, to examine the use of knowledge resource types. Analysis showed that contextual resources and the interaction with the physical affordances play a significant role in learners' capacity to see relations between given case information and new conceptual knowledge, as well as, activating prior knowledge resources. Overall findings indicate that autonomous learning rests essentially on the learning design, the appropriate measure at pre-structuring, as well as, student-and- teacher readiness.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:52Z (GMT).

New members usually lack the necessary knowledge to interact successfully with more experienced members of a scientific community and to find collaboration partners. We investigated how the level of community participation and support for community knowledge were related to the building of new collaborative relationships during a scientific conference. Participants' interaction behavior was tracked using RFID devices; social network questionnaires and a bibliographic analysis provided additional data. We found that newcomers do not interact less with other participants than experienced members, but develop fewer collaborative relationships. The chances that newcomers' interactions lead to the building of new collaborative relationships were increased by access to explicit relevant community knowledge. Making such knowledge explicit seems to be a useful means for supporting newcomers in scientific communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Using pop- ular Web 2.0 features, our wiki provides additional means of participation and aims to encour- age direct communication and collaboration between users. Additionally, using intelligent features, we enable the wiki system itself to also participate during collaboration. In this pa- per, we analyze the results of a study using the Written Agora in a classroom for two semes- ters. We discover that simply including such features is not necessarily enough to cause their use or improve collaboration.

We describe the individual actions that students perform and show that turn-taking rather than simultaneous access is the most common collaboration strategy. We identify implicit round-robin and complementary interruption as two policies regulating the turn-taking strategy. We also investigate floor-control mechanisms, showing that dyads with free access trade turns at a higher frequency, and that the tendency towards turn-taking in this blended learning situation may lessen the need for floor control mechanisms. Overall, we find that collaborative note- taking as a pedagogical practice provides rich opportunities for epistemic deepening and tight collaboration between students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:53Z (GMT).

We consider the relationship of directive and facilitative forms of other- regulation with efforts to negotiate competence, given that directive other-regulators may raise doubts about relative ability. Three groups of four 7th grade students were observed while working on two collaborative activities during an inquiry-based science unit. Results suggest the nature and quality of facilitative and directive other-regulation varies, with directive regulators focused on controlling the task product in ways that excluded others' attempts to contribute. In response, teammates worked to renegotiate their positions of competence within the group to ensure their ideas were considered for integration. The focus on relative competence promoted by directive other-regulation may diminish a focus on group learning, given the social nature of joint activity.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:53Z (GMT).

Our goal is to investigate how design revisions to the activity in the form of 1.) Explicit representations of students' shared experiences, 2.) Access to an underlying third level of alleles, and 3.) Transparent rules of interaction facilitated abstraction of population-level trends in terms of change over time. We draw on data from two iterations of an agent-based modeling curriculum for evolution as part of a design-based research study in three tenth grade biology classes in the mid-west. The findings hold implications for the design of participatory simulations in general, and ways to support meaningful learning about complex multi-level phenomena in particular.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:54Z (GMT).

This approach informs group members about their collaborators' knowledge structures and underlying information visualized by digital concept maps. In our study, we investigated whether this approach may reduce undesirable effects of mutual trust. Trust is an important influencing factor with regard to behavior and performance of groups. High mutual trust can have a negative impact on group effectiveness because it reduces mutual control and, as a result, the detection of the others' mistakes. In an empirical study, 20 triads collaborating with the knowledge and information awareness approach were compared with 20 triads collaborating without this approach. The members of a triad were spatially-distributed and collaborated computer-supported. The results demonstrated that the availability of the knowledge and information awareness approach overrides the negative impact of too much mutual trust.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:54Z (GMT).

Through statistical and structural analysis of their concept maps, we investigate changes in the students' understandings about alternative energy. Our findings suggest that students increased their knowledge about alternative energies at different levels, reflecting both surface and deep learning of related environmental education concepts, as well as creating strong connections between concepts related to safety, costs, and health for different types of alternative energy. In addition, student elaboration increased for all energy types, suggesting that the jigsaw pedagogy was successful in improving individual understandings.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:54Z (GMT).

In this paper we report on a project to define the complex competence of L2L2 and to support it with a set of web-based tools and associated pedagogy, the Metafora Project. The system we develop embodies our theory of L2L2 and the results of our design-based research suggest that this system can succeed in making key elements of L2L2 explicit in the talk and actions of groups of learners. Learning how to learn (L2L) is often referred to as the most important knowledge age skill since it equips people to adapt flexibly in a time of rapid change (OECD, 2001; 2004). However, we argue that the reality of Internet mediated learning is more about learning how to learn together (L2L2) with others than about learning to learn as an individual. L2L2 goes beyond L2L because it combines the dimension of task management, (how to organise complex inquiries with multiple stages and strands) with the dimension of social relationships (working with attitudes, expectations and identities in order to participate constructively in learning as a collective accomplishment). In this paper we report on a project that attempts to define the complex competence of L2L2 and to support it with a Metafora system (Wegerif et al, 2012), which includes a planning and reflection tool; a dynamic concept mapping space (Loll et al, 2011) and a chat, and associated pedagogy. In the first part of this paper we characterise L2L2, presenting elements of our design framework for teaching L2L2 and in the second part of this paper we describe design-based research used to test and refine the theory of L2L2 presented in the first part and to develop the working Metafora system. Part 1: Characterising L2L2 Transferable learning skills and competences such as L2L have mainly been understood as the attributes of individuals. L2L2 is different because it is primarily the attribute of a group or collective. We hope that individuals who participate in one group acquire skills and competences that they can take with them when they go to work with other groups. However, these skills and competences are essentially social and do not exist outside of social interaction. Viewed through the analytic lens of the group, L2L2 is about group norms that support distributed leadership, mutual engagement, peer assessment, and collective thinking. Teaching skills and competences to groups can be understood as a form of intentional culture change (Cobb &amp; Bauersfeld, 1995; Wegerif, 2002). This process can be partly understood using a modified version of a commonly used schema in the teaching of individual skills: the process of moving from unconscious incompetence, through conscious incompetence, to conscious competence and on, eventually, to unconscious competence (Howell, 1982). The implicit norms of the culture in a classroom can be changed in a similar way. One important difference between teaching individual skills and changing cultures is that cultures are people plus tools including communications technology. This means that the tools that support communication within a culture are not only scaffolds that will fade away as new skills and competences are learnt but these tools can also be essential enablers of collective thoughts and actions (Pea, 1993). The Metafora system is designed to serve a dual role of supporting the teaching and learning of L2L2 and supporting the continuing practice of L2L2. This means that it provides tools to help make group norms explicit and change the culture but it also provides tools to help groups that are already good at L2L2 work together effectively and creatively. In the first stage of this pedagogy the groups are made aware that they need to coordinate their work together but are not sure how best to do this, this initial stage is called the `challenge' when they are presented with a complex problem. Explicit tools are provided by the Metafora system to support them. These tools, especially icons representing aspects of L2L2 (Table 1), make some of the implicit norms followed by effective groups, explicit. In the full system icons, representing aspects of L2L2, are combined with dynamic concept mapping spaces for discussions (LASAD, see Figure 2), microworlds and a pedagogical strategy.

In this work, we describe the implementation of AMOEBA a new system that helps computer science instructors support student collaboration through live visualization of similarities in students' programs. We explore a single, 40-minute session of students learning to program for the first time. In that session, the teacher used AMOEBA to pair up students with similar programs to work together successfully; paired students' programs both became more similar to their partner and, on average, scored more goals. We then discuss implications and future directions for AMOEBA, including ways that it could be adapted to better support collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:56Z (GMT).

In the first part of this paper, I will bring forward an innovative pedagogical approach for collaborative learning of math problem solving, accompanied by appropriate software (1) Metafora's planning tool: a visual based planning and reflecting space for socio-meta-cognitive elicitation of collaborative learning processes, and, (2) Geogebra: a math application for the creation of dynamic Geometric figures in Cartesian domain. In the second part of this paper I will illustrate a learning scenario within the context of a collaborative math problem solving scenario. Then, I will highlight a behavior of collaborative learning, in which one team member, S1, makes progress with solving the problem, and goes back to help his peer, S2. S1 scaffolds his peer's work by (1) Reporting what he, S1, did on the shared planning-reflecting space (2) Monitoring his peer's error (3) Explicating this error to his peer (4) scaffolding his peer's construction of a Geogebra model, without giving him the whole answer. This observation serves as an important progress in the attempts of modern educators, and education design-researchers, to share some of the responsibility of the learning processes with students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:56Z (GMT).

In this paper, we examine quantitative trends of participation in a youth design site focused on programming. Scratch is an online community with over 1 million registered youth designers 11-18 years of age. Drawing on a random sample of 5,000 youth programmers and their activities over three months in early 2012, we examined log files that captured the frequency of their contributions and comments on the site, making visible distinct classes of users who engaged in different sets of practices that support design on a collective scale.

One group of fifth-graders was offered incentives and another group was not offered incentives. The feedback afforded by the videogame was expected to mitigate predicted negative effects of incentives. No significant motivational effects of incentives were found across engagement levels: immediate (engagement with resources), close (participation in drafting in-game reports), proximal (self- reported situational interest) or distal (gains in self-reported personal interest). Nearly all of the differences that were found favored the incentive condition. Students in the incentive condition showed significantly larger gains in conceptual understanding (proximal) and non- significantly larger gains in achievement (distal). These results suggest that the predicted negative consequences of extrinsic incentives may be addressed or even reversed in this new generation of learning environments, and point to value for a multi-level model of assessment and engagement.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:57Z (GMT).

In fact, as inequality of participation increases especially when there is a free-rider in a group the call for diversified assessment intensifies. The topic of classroom assessment has remained implicit in wide areas of research on (CS)CL. More specifically, the issue as to how we can support teachers and students in both monitoring and assessment of collaborative learning processes and products has hardly been addressed systematically. This panel brings together researchers from the (CS)CL community to discuss and explore how research instruments can be transformed for classroom assessment purposes including the role of technology and what we as (CS)CL community could offer to teachers and students alike.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:57Z (GMT).

In this perspective, we propose two concepts: the student's twofold semiosis and the teacher's equilibration work, which allow us to understand the instructional practice and the learning process in the same conceptualization. We illustrate these concepts and our video research methodology with a case study in videoconferencing at primary school (Second Language Learning). We attempt to clarify how this technology-enhanced learning environment enables a reconstruction of the learning situation in a specific inquiry process, requiring a particular teacher's equilibration work and a specific student's entitlement. We eventually argue that the Joint Action Theory in Didactics could contribute to the development of Learning Sciences research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:58Z (GMT).

The teacher is called to pay attention in a great repertoire of productive interactions that enables him/her to promote creative programming activities. The framework presented here involves underlying dialogic processes from seven collaborative and creative dimensions that allow students to develop both adaptive and innovative creativity in programming. Students can simultaneously activate two or more ideas, images, or thoughts and have them interact, prompt thought experiments, change cognitive perspectives, raise new points of view, and risk category mistakes during computer programming.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:59Z (GMT).

Their ability to synchronously accommodate multiple users is an advantage in co- located collaborative design tasks. This paper explores the potential of Multi-touch interfaces in collaborative Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagramming by comparing them to a PC- based tool and evaluating the collaborative learning skills and level of physical interaction in both conditions. The results indicate that even though participants conversed more in the PC- based condition, the use of the Multi-touch table increased the level of physical interaction and encouraged ""creative conflict"" skills amongst the team members.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:51:59Z (GMT).

Pairs of students enrolled in a psychology course performed a task where they attempted to explain to their partners the meanings of technical psychological terms. During the task, they interacted with an affect-based conversational agent, which was programmed to provide back-channel feedback and metacognitive suggestions through visual and/or audio output. The study compared students' performance after using this agent with their performance after using an agent without audio output or affective expressions. Our findings suggested that the use of multiple communication channels for feedback facilitates collaborative learners' understanding of concepts. This provides implications for designing pedagogical agents for effective collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:01Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The goal was to both develop a brief instructional unit with minimal resource requirements, and to examine students' initial understanding of complex systems concepts based on this unit. Early elementary students (aged six to seven) were randomly assigned to six mixed-ability groups of five students (N=30) who participated either in a scaffolded, teacher-led inquiry session with the BeeSign simulation software or a teacher-led book reading session, both centered on honeybees collecting nectar. Statistical analysis of a direct measure and transfer measures indicated that while students in both conditions developed initial understanding of systems related concepts, those in the BeeSign inquiry condition significantly outperformed their peers. Video analyses reveal that designing the simulation around teacher-scaffolded inquiry prompts led to more student articulations of their ideas and opportunities to examine prior misconceptions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:03Z (GMT).

The analysis was conducted at various levels in order to model students' map construction processes, the map construction processes in conjunction with students' discourse, and processes observed within each group versus across all groups. Transitional state diagrams produced from the sequential analysis of each group's behaviors revealed unique sequential patterns in the processes used between the three groups. These observed processes provide potential explanations for the observed differences in the accuracy of the maps between the groups. The implications of the findings and directions for further refinements to the techniques and software tools are identified and discussed in further detail.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:04Z (GMT).

This paper presents an empirical study in which high school students' collaborative online search behavior (as a learning process measure) as well as their online search competence (as individual learning outcome) were targeted by small group collaboration scripts and classroom scripts. Both the small group collaboration script and a plenary-plus-group level classroom script yielded positive effects on online search activities during collaboration. When no or just one scaffold was given, correlations between the quality of collaborative online search activities and individual online search competence (as learning outcome) were positive. When both interventions were combined, however, the correlation disappeared, indicating that although this combination helped students act on a higher level during collaboration, it did not contribute to individual learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:06Z (GMT).

Despite the prevalence of digital media and social networking, relatively little research has been conducted on the presence and benefits of social learning in educational video games. Preliminary studies suggest that by facilitating interactive and engaging experiences, video games offer opportunities for players to engage in problem-solving, socialization, and most importantly, collaborative learning. As the doctor began to extract the ectoderm cells that he had painstakingly cultured for today's spinal surgery he cringed at the idea of repeating this procedure again. ""You're going to kill those cells,"" said his assistant. ""Shut up,"" replied the doctor, ""I know what I'm doing."" Just then the cells began to decompose. ""See,"" affirmed his assistant, ""I told you"". ""It's fine,"" sighed the doctor ""You were right, next time we'll try it your way."" While this vignette may sound at first like an exchange between two physicians, it is actually a conversation between two high school students playing Progenitor X, an educational video game focused on regenerative biology concepts. Interactions of this nature are commonplace and frequently written off as a casual disagreement amongst game players. However, these conversations provide evidence of a rich collaborative learning experience taking place during video game play. Unlike other educational delivery systems, video games offer the opportunity to construct learning experiences through a combination of social interactions and immersive gameplay. Early research has indicated that some games are effective at facilitating learning gains (Squire, 2004) but the source of these gains is unknown. Studies suggest the primary benefit of educational gaming is purely motivational. While content knowledge has served as the benchmark for assessing the effectiveness of learning from video games. Current findings suggest that a tremendous amount of experiential learning is taking place unbeknownst to the player or observer. This aspect of collaborative learning could have far reaching implications for future game development, but has thus far gone largely unobserved. There have been myriad applications of digital media for creating communities of gamers in online networks, but these have largely been viewed as serving a recreational function. Collaborative learning, on the other hand, has been studied extensively and shown to result in content learning gains by as much as 50% in formal educational settings (Johnson et al, 1981). Despite widespread acceptance of the benefits of collaborative learning and the nature of games as a catalyst for social interaction, relatively little research has been conducted on the benefits of video games towards stimulating collaborative learning (Amory, 2007). While the focus of video game effectiveness has centered largely on individual content learning, Foko asserts that games provide the context and information to accomplish a task; yet it is the social interactions between peers and technology that result in new understanding (Foko, 2006). It has been determined that the observational recording of gameplay provides a unique and naturalistic approach to observing collaborative learning without hindering experimentation of the subject. The CyberSTEM games study focuses on collaborative learning within a suite of educational STEM-focused games developed by the Educational Research Integrated Area (ERIA) under the direction of Dr. Kurt Squire. Rockman et al (REA), an independent research and evaluation company is utilizing a multi-method approach to study social interaction and problem solving during game play. To date, REA has observed 28 peer-peer dyads playing Progenitor X. These dyads were recorded via webcam and screen capture software to observe social interactions and conversations off-screen while simultaneously recording their activities on-screen as they navigated through various game activities. Instances of collaborative discussion including shared problem solving, providing and requesting help, delivering praise, as well as task switching and player conflicts over controls have been recorded and coded for the purposes of observing collaborative learning patterns within gameplay. These recordings were supplemented with pre/post survey data and post-interviews which","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We tested the interface against two non-tangible input comparison conditions (single- and multi-mouse) to control for access differences. To determine if groups' solutions displayed sensitivity to emergent spatial patterns, we constructed a quantitative ""dynamism"" measure, and found that solutions produced in the tangible condition were significantly more spatially sensitive. To better understand why, we conducted a case study by selecting two representative participant groups and performing qualitative multimodal analyses of participant speech and gesture. Our findings indicate that the tangible interface's greater affordance of gesture allowed participants to express concepts containing both spatial and temporal properties, with the added benefit of increasing the agency of less-verbally participatory group members to explore and contribute their ideas more equitably.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:08Z (GMT).

Specifically, the group went through a stage of productive subjective failure before intentionally deciding to explicate and negotiate their own group norms. This transition saw a marked increase in collaboration among group members. Using a micro-genetic interpretive approach, we analyzed the stages of group development that led to this outcome. Our findings indicate that the process of explicating and negotiating norms (PENN) was the climactic event whereby the group transformed their responsibility and collaborative learning behavior. We discuss the implications of our findings, which we believe inform both theory and design of productive failure in CSCL.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:09Z (GMT).

Data from two pairs of middle- school students, using two different scaffolding scripts, and from their biology teacher, were collected and analyzed. The following research questions were pursued: How does each collaboration script influence students' help-seeking and teachers' help-giving activity? Data included videotapes of each pair's interactions, the discussions between the pairs and the teacher, whole-class discussions, learning assessments and a teacher interview. Findings indicated that the pair in the ImplicitScaffolding script sought help less frequently than the ExplicitScaffolding pair while the nature of the help sought was different. Findings also showed that the different scaffolding scripts impacted student motivation and framed the teacher expectations differently, regardless of the type of help sought by the students. These findings highlight the connection between collaboration scripts, teacher cognition and scaffolding, and bear implications about students and teachers.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:10Z (GMT).

The first decade of research on the educational use of mobile technology is divided in this paper into four stages: (i) a period of mobility and personal digital assistants; (ii) the era of wireless Internet learning devices; (iii) the introduction of social mobile media; and (iv) a ubiquitous future. In addition, three empirical case studies are used as examples of these developmental stages. These case studies demonstrate the diversity of contexts, methods, and technologies used, ranging from workplace to nature trail, from inquiry learning to collaborative knowledge building, and from PocketPCs to smartphones.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:12Z (GMT).

Drawing on data from a multi-year research project to help children hack gaming technologies for science inquiry, we examine both technological and social advantages that repurposing everyday technologies for offers for learning abstract STEM concepts. In light of trends towards increased decentralization of education, we extend these findings into a general discussion of the potential for embedding CSCL into the design of everyday things.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:13Z (GMT).

However, it is unclear whether these benefits are based on the cognitive processes related to the problem-solving activity prior to instruction or originate from comparing and contrasting students' solutions to the canonical solution during subsequent instruction. To separate these effects, we conducted a quasi-experimental study with 240 students varying the two factors timing of instruction (problem-solving prior to instruction versus instruction prior to problem- solving) and form of instruction (standard instruction versus instruction that compares and contrasts typical student solutions). Our results indicate that comparing and contrasting typical student solutions is a prerequisite for the effectiveness of problem-solving prior to instruction. Problem-solving prior to instruction combined with instruction where student solutions were compared and contrasted to the canonical solution outperformed all other conditions. Problem-solving prior to standard instruction was no more effective than standard instruction prior to problem-solving.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Interacting with large projected displays of animated rainforest flora and fauna, students worked as ""field researchers"" to observe changes in life forms occurring over a 200 million year span. Students gathered evidence of evolution using networked tablet computers that scaffolded their interactions with peers and with the room itself. Improvements from the first to the second design iteration focused on (1) improving content-focused interactions within the simulation; (2) improving the integration of the simulation activity into the overall curriculum; (3) improving embodied interactions of students working within the physical space. Student explanations from the second implementation demonstrated increased variation in evolutionary topics compared to those in the first iteration. Key design features from the two iterations are discussed with respect to the observed interaction patterns.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:17Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Emerging tabletop devices can offer new means to enhance teachers' classroom control and awareness. These technologies can help them orchestrate activities, and capture, analyse and visualise students' collaborative interactions. This paper presents MTClassroom and MTDashboard, that were designed, deployed and tested to support the teacher in orchestrating collaborative learning activities at an authentic classroom. MTClassroom is an enriched multi- tabletop environment that captures aspects of students' activity as they work in small groups. MTDashboard is an orchestration tool displayed at a handheld device, giving the teacher control over classroom activities and providing `real-time' indicators of participation and task progress of each group. We analysed teacher's attention by triangulating quantitative evidence captured by our environment with qualitative observations and teacher's perceptions. We investigated the affordances of our environment and the impact of the information provided to the teacher through the MTDashboard. The contribution of this paper is the novel approach for providing teachers with key indicators of small-group collaboration in the classroom and analysing their impact on teachers' attention to help them manage their time more effectively.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:21Z (GMT).

The study was based on a sequence of inquiry-based mobile learning activities within the domain of natural sciences and mathematics education. We questioned the effects of collaborative scaffolding, and the effects scaffolding provided by technology have on learning and performance. Based on a quantitative interaction analysis, findings are presented illuminating, on the one hand, the interesting potentials of mobile learning, and on the other, some serious challenges that need to be met in order to realize those potentials meaningfully. For instance, some of the findings presented shows that low-achievement students benefits from this kind of activities; that learning technologies have multiple effects on learning, both positive and negative, and that the roles of teachers is as important as before the introduction of learning technologies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:22Z (GMT).

The critical finding is the identification of a pivotal sequence of interaction occurring in the later half of the activity in which one member of the group proposes an innovation for illuminating two light bulbs in a single circuit. The proposal and its subsequent endorsement by the other members are contingent on an immediately prior interaction in which the group appropriates another group's circuit diagram. Together, this pair of adjacent sequential structures exposes multiple instances of uptake between participants. These uptake relations are realized through an ensemble of contingencies consisting of persistent diagrams, tabletop materials, and a locally situated interactional practice. Our analysis shows how the participants' actions transform the setting and how these transformations are consequential for how the group proceeds in the learning activity.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:23Z (GMT).

They help to make inferences about the partner and can strongly influence task performance. Due to limitations of emotional cues in computer-mediated collaboration (CMC), the collaborative process can be impacted. In this study, we report on the effect of an Emotion Awareness Tool (EAT) designed to facilitate the sharing of emotions between partners, on the perceived emotions after collaboration and the perceived quality of the interaction. Results showed that the EAT stimulated participants to engage in a mutual modeling of emotions. In the EAT condition, the perceived amount of time spent on emotion modeling process was positively correlated to the perceived intensity of positive emotions after collaboration. The EAT increased the perceived degree of transactivity, but only for women. This study provides a first step in exploring the effect of emotion awareness in CMC tasks including a comparing approach for its gender-specific relevance.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:25Z (GMT).

We examined how gender composition within groups affects learning outcomes. Students from sixth, seventh, and eighth grade classes from three US Midwestern public school districts with diverse demographic compositions (N=637, 314 boys and 323 girls) participated in this study as a part of their regular science class during a 12-week design-based physics curriculum, CoMPASS. We conducted two 5 x 2 analyses of covariance to evaluate the effect of group gender ratio and gender on students' physics learning and science practice outcomes. Results indicate that group gender ratio does influence students' science learning and practices as measured by posttest differences. Students in mixed-gender groups performed significantly better than students in same-gender groups. Having at least one group member of the opposite gender increased individual students' posttest performance. Limitations and implications for practice are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In contrast, we argue that research on tangible and touchable interfaces must focus on the quality of interactions. We introduce the concept of framing and resource activation in studying the nature of the collaborative activity within tangible interfaces. We observed 40 five year-old children engaging in a math-series activity with either a tangible or single-mouse input, and uncovered four categories of behavioral clusters which accounted for 90% of student interactions. We found a positive correlation between exploratory talk and synchrony cluster (i.e., shared responsibility over the action) particularly on the single-mouse condition, and a negative correlation with passiveness/individual behavior (no negotiation of the actions), predominantly on the tangible condition. This suggests a tension for designers as they aim to balance the learning benefits of focused individual engagement with those that stem from collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:26Z (GMT).

Typically, these environments provide multiple external representations (MERs) for students to understand and communicate scientific knowledge. However, little is known about how students organize knowledge in MERs when they engage in collaborative argumentation. In this study, we designed an argumentation based science unit in a computer supported collaborative learning environment. We investigated how this learning environment affected students' knowledge organization and argumentation on the socio-scientific issue of nuclear energy. We found that the students used all the available representational modes in the environment to make sound arguments and it appeared that the textual representation knowledge entries were the most linked nodes in the knowledge web the students produced as a group.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:27Z (GMT).

Here we compare those results with an ""in the wild"" implementation of our system. We found that learning gains were significantly lower in the classroom compared to a laboratory setting.

A central challenge for videogames research in education is to demonstrate evidence of player learning. Assessment designers need to attend to the ways in which gameplay itself can provide a powerful new form of assessment. The GBA model has two key layers which build on content-based educational game design: a semantic template that determines which click-stream data events could be indicators of learning; and learning telemetry that captures data for analysis. This study highlights how the GBA was implemented in a stem-cell science learning game, and shows how the GBA demonstrates a relationship among success, kinds of failure, and learning in the game.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:31Z (GMT).

The analysis of the learners' use of EMU implied that learners who wrote good essays tended to focus on annotations that used affective tags to express negative, sceptical and surprised attitudes toward the document, as opposed to comments in general; in contrast, low-scoring writers tended to apply equal attention to all comments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:32Z (GMT).

Thus, knowledge construction is simultaneously an individual and social process that requires group cognition and situated meanings. However, while the CSCL researchers have investigated the situated knowledge in the process of collective thinking, little work has been done to fully understand how different identity categories play a role in sense-making and knowledge construction. This research, therefore, explored in detail how individuals utilize their different identity categories to make situated meanings when they collaborate with each other in the process of knowledge construction in online learning environments. Results demonstrated that individuals do not experience online learning through only one aspect of their identity but rather that learning experiences evoke different elements of their identities that are used continuously and simultaneously when they collaborate with each other at the every phase of knowledge construction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:33Z (GMT).

We obtain log data from the Peer-to-Peer University (P2PU) and: (1) outline our methods to move from raw data to developing metrics that can help explore how to promote deeper participation and persistence rates in open courses, and (2) describe some preliminary findings about different metrics of participation and persistence in P2PU, culled from their log data. Introduction Open, online learning is a fast rising phenomenon in computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL). The growing library of open education resources (OER) combined with increased technology availability has created trends toward massively open online courses (MOOCs). Highly visible ventures such as Coursera, Udacity, and EdX have garnered much attention by attracting tens of thousands of learners (and sometimes hundreds of thousands) to their courses (Pappano, 2012). There are also other types of open online learning paradigms that are more learner-driven, bottom-up, and peer-to-peer. One such platform is the Peer-to-Peer University (P2PU), which is the focus of our research. In all of these different online learning platforms, the issue of learner participation and persistence is critical. Only a small number of learners even finish many of the high profile MOOC courses (Pappano, 2012), and peer-to-peer learning platforms are directly dependent on teacher and learner interactions to keep courses robust and active (Ahn, Weng, &amp; Butler, 2013). A ripe area for future research is to understand metrics of participation and persistence in open, online learning. In this poster, we describe our early research with raw log data of the P2PU platform. We outline our methodologies in working with this data and preliminary findings about potential metrics of engagement that will inform future work. Methodology This study is a part of an ongoing partnership with P2PU where we are exploring how to create publicly sharable datasets and conduct analyses of this widely used open education platform. A major challenge of this type of research is to transform raw log data into a usable dataset that can be used to derive insight into open, online learning. We obtained data from P2PU that represented a log of all elements of the platform (e.g. courses, users, and learning activities etc.) in addition to all interactions that learners have had. This data captures a live snapshot of the system in July 2012. All measures represent the system at that point in time. We used SQL to identify the tables, relationships, and data they contain. We also conducted direct observations of the P2PU.org website to identify how members go about: (a) joining learning communities, (b) interacting with peers, and (c) participate in learning groups. We then identified how these interactions with the P2PU.org community were represented in the underlying database structure. One critical issue in online platforms surrounds participation and persistence in open courses, so we concentrated our data investigation on understanding the characteristics of users and courses. We also developed a descriptive understanding of the P2PU ecosystem. Some of the characteristics we explored include: categories of courses in P2PU, the status of courses, the participation levels in courses, and the grouping of courses into schools. Another goal of this initial analysis was to derive variables relevant to concepts of participation, engagement, and persistence in courses. Working from the data structures provided in the P2PU platform, we defined three types of measures that could be salient for future studies: 1. Basic engagement: The P2PU data allows us to track basic measures of course participation such as the number of participants, followers, and organizers associated with each course. We can also understand participation from the user's perspective, such as how many courses on average a user is a participant in. 2. Active participation: Beyond basic counts of participation, we also defined examples of active participation where users make explicit contributions to P2PU courses. These measures include statistics such as the number of comments shared in courses or learning groups. 3. Metrics of Persistence: We were also interested in measures that reflect whether learners complete learning tasks and progress through courses. We derived two types of metrics from the P2PU log data. a. Task Completion Rate Many P2PU courses have tasks that learners are asked to complete. We were able to derive an average completion rate for each P2PU course, which was found by calculating how many tasks on average, participants completed, divided by the total number of tasks designed in a given course. In this way, we may be able to compare the completion rates of different types of courses in P2PU in future work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:35Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

A randomized, two-group pretest-posttest research design was used to compare the effects of the IECS with a general collaboration script (CS) on students' collaborative learning in culturally heterogeneous groups in a CSCL environment. In this study, Master students from a university in the Netherlands (74 subjects, representing 22 countries) worked in dyads on an environmental problem about biodiversity collapse in tropical forest protected areas. The results showed that the IECS positively affected students' attitude towards online collaboration and satisfaction with learning processes and outcomes. Student groups in both conditions achieved comparable task performance and exhibited a comparable level of willingness to collaborate online.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:35Z (GMT).

The children's learning processes are torn between the necessity to `function on demand' and perform well in school lessons, tests and educational surveys, and the need for playful exploration. This study of computer-related project work in an intercultural after-school initiative explores the interplay and interdependence of child learning in formal and informal contexts. Main findings indicate that a close link of both contexts can 1) support the learning effect, and 2) strengthen the after-school initiative's standing, 3) increase potential learner's motivation to participate in it, and 4) locally support cross-cultural understanding and respect.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:35Z (GMT).

The context of the study was HAL Online, an undergraduate course in The Learning Sciences that enrolled 44 students. Using a nested design (students within groups within treatment), the treatment condition, Trained Argumentation with Modest Scaffolding (TAMS) was compared with an ecological control group: Emergent Argumentation with Modest Scaffolding (EAMS). Results of quantitative analyses indicated that TAMS was an effective intervention that positively influenced students' individual learning as measured by a test of scientific literacy and scores from coding of individual reflective blogs. Direct training in argumentation offers a viable, pragmatic supplement or alternative to immersive collaborative pedagogies that require guidance and scaffolding of students' online argumentation processes by faculty (Cavagnetto, 2010).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:36Z (GMT).

Although professional development (PD) can be used to overcome these barriers, there is a dearth of descriptions of PD programs that foster change towards CSCL practice. This paper presents an approach to PD centered on the notion of orchestrating CSCL activities, and exemplifies it through teacher workshops. The evidence from a mixed methods evaluation of two such workshops highlights the potential of this approach in driving conceptual change, and increasing the perceived feasibility of using CSCL, even in limited-time PD interventions. The results also show the limitations of the approach when used in isolation, hinting at multi-level coordinated actions (e.g. institutional, policy-level ones) to further foster CSCL practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:37Z (GMT).

Behavioral, lexical, and network structure analyses were applied to the work of two Grade 2 classes engaged in knowledge building in science. Two variations of feedback including vocabulary and contribution-based visualizations were integrated into the knowledge building practice of the experimental class. Behavioral and lexical measures were calculated with automated tools, and content analysis was used to evaluate depth of understanding. Moreover, the degree of vocabulary distribution throughout the communities was explored. Findings show that formative feedback embedded in knowledge building practices can help students grow their vocabulary, apply new words in productive ways in their writing, and advance community knowledge. Results also show that as students learn and use a more diverse range of words in the context of knowledge building, the more discursively connected they become, and the greater the knowledge distribution across the community.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:38Z (GMT).

As they carry out their responsibilities, they gain work skills and the community benefits from their contributions. With young people spending more time online, how might they build similar skills while contributing to the online communities they engage in? In this paper we examine the experience of youth who have taken on leadership roles within Scratch, a creative online community. We identify the main challenges these youth encountered, the strategies they used to manage these challenges, and what they learned in the process. Their descriptions suggest a progression from learning to carry out their responsibilities in collaboration with other team members to eventually developing their own visions for improving the community. We have found that these roles provide pathways of participation and deeper engagement for youth interested in contributing to online communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:39Z (GMT).

Several games develop collaborative participatory science skills while expanding games based learning into adult informal learning.

Socio-cultural psychologists have suggested that intersubjectivity is central for maintenance of face-to-face communication. We study here how communication is maintained in synchronous discussions and whether intersubjectivity is reached. Four university students used a CMC tool to discuss an educational issue. One week later, each student was interviewed on his/her views on the issue. Then, the technique of cued retrospective reporting was used to uncover how each student interpreted each move of the synchronous discussion. The cross analysis of the interviews and the reporting showed that actions were not co-ordinated. Agreements and disagreements were not shared, and order of actions was quite whimsical. We conclude that intersubjectivity was not established. However, communication was maintained through a process of co-alienation the juxtaposition of incompatible alignments of representations through a common external representation. Although co-alienation is problematic, we show that discussants could learn from the e- discussion.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Social Networking Sites (SNSs) offer researchers rich new opportunities to create educational interventions that are deeply connected to learners' lives and relationships. We discuss legal and ethical challenges, and possible solutions to them, that face educational researchers as they begin to do DBR on SNSs. Addressing these issues will be crucial to design researchers wishing to use SNSs as sites for learning, and also offers an opportunity for the CSCL community to shape SNS research far beyond our field. Introduction Online social networking sites (SNSs) are powerful research tools because of their wide reach and deep connectivity to users' lives. In 2011, approximately 42% of U.S. adults belonged to a SNS (Hampton, Goulet, Ranie, &amp; Purcell, 2011). In 2010, 73% of online U.S. teens used SNSs (Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, &amp; Zickuhr, 2010). Facebook had over 1 billion users in October of 2012; one twelfth of the entire world's population now uses Facebook's mobile apps (Facebook, 2012), highlighting the enormous connectedness of social media to users' daily routines. SNS-based research offers learning scientists the opportunity both to understand human social activity, and to use SNSs for experimental interventions, such as increasing civic participation (Bond et al., 2012) or teaching about science (Shapiro, Squire, and ERIA, 2011). While observational studies offer researchers the ability to analyze activity including learning as it is already occurring, Design-Based Research (DBR) enables researchers to support and study new kinds of educational interactions (Brown, 1992; Collins, 1992). Though the number of studies conducted in SNS environments is growing, few DBR studies have been conducted to date. Instead the research has largely focused on publicly available data about extant activities. Doing DBR on social networks offers researchers new opportunities to connect to learners' lives, and to understand how learning happens across levels of space, time, and scale. For example, a recent design experiment conducted by political scientists collaborating with Facebook staff reached over 60 million people and led to over 300,000 more of them voting in the 2010 United States elections (Bond et al., 2012). With SNSs we can build learning experiences that are deeply intertwined with learners' personal interests, and those of their friends and loved ones, such as by using information gleaned from users' posts on their Facebook feeds, or the content of web pages they've ""liked."" We can virally scale participation in learning environments by using the social sharing mechanisms that are central to SNSs, encouraging learners to invite their friends to learn along with them. We might use slow-moving interaction designs similar to social games like FarmVille to immerse learners in distributed embedded phenomena (Moher, 2006) that stretch over long periods of time and that differ depending upon users' physical locations. All of these possibilities highlight new opportunities for researchers to support and to understand learning at both individual and collective scales, over differing time scales, and to inform and study these experiences using new kinds of data. Standard methodologies, tools, and norms for doing DBR on SNSs have not yet emerged, and we currently lack ethical frameworks for working with the unprecedentedly private data that SNS DBR makes available to researchers. Observational studies are already pushing boundaries; DBR will push further, such as by offering access to more information, exposure of information to, and about, peers. As learning scientists begin to develop DBR programs for SNS, we must also begin to develop a legal and ethical groundwork for doing our work in an appropriate manner. This groundwork can ultimately inform not just study design but the design of CSCL tools as well. Fields beyond the learning sciences are beginning to consider these issues as well (Introne, et al., 2013), and educational researchers have an opportunity to shape both the policy and the research practice landscape of SNS DBR. The authors of this paper are, respectively, a learning scientist and a legal scholar specializing in bioethics who is a member of her university's IRB and the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Advisory Committee on Human Research Protections (the analysis in this paper is our own and is not an opinion of any committee or governmental agency). We have begun working together to lay the necessary legal and ethical groundwork for DBR on SNSs. This paper illustrates the possibilities for DBR on SNSs using an example drawn from our own work, then discusses some of the legal and ethical considerations that educational researchers, as well as Federal regulators and university IRBs, must wrestle with for work like it to precede. Our legal analysis is grounded in study of US regulations including the Code of Federal Regulations, the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (the ""Common Rule""), as well as case law, though the ethical issues we raise are globally applicable.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:44Z (GMT).

In order to identify a specific discourse structure underlying successful collaboration, we used a remotely controllable robot as a member of a small discussion group of college students who solved a challenging physics problem. For the robot to act as a listener who solicits voices from students in the group, we manipulated its ways of ""revoicing"": it performed minimum revoicing of students' keywords without evaluative comments in one condition and guiding revoicing towards scientific models in the other condition. Comparing these two conditions in addition to a human-only condition, we found that the robot's minimum revoicing fostered students' agency and reflection on their mental models, which prepared them to learn from a lecture and solve a transfer problem. The role of listener for PFL was discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:45Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The online discourse adopted a flexible collaboration structure: fixed small group collaboration in the first eight weeks, and opportunistic collaboration in the second eight weeks. The data were collected from students' online discourse notes and assignment tasks. Group differences in small group collaboration and differences between two collaboration structures were examined. Findings indicated that flexible collaboration design helped students to work towards constructive discourse progressively. The study also provided evidence of how students new to principle-based approach engaged in online discourse for conceptual understanding in the Chinese context.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:45Z (GMT).

However, CSCL analyses generally focus on only one of these units, even in multi-method approaches. Moreover, there is little data-based analysis of how the three levels are connected. This paper proposes that the levels of individual learning, group cognition and community knowledge building are connected by interactional resources, which can mediate between the levels. A theory of the connection of the levels is sketched. Then examples of such connections by interactional resources are presented from logs of several CSCL experiments. Finally, a curriculum for gradually providing math teachers and math students with a complex of resources relevant to dynamic geometry is described as an example of how to support the connection of small-group interaction with individual understanding and with cultural practices in a CSCL adaptation of geometry education.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:45Z (GMT).

Interviews revealed that learners used private messaging to coordinate activity on group projects, request help from each other, and seek reassurance when uncertain about their performance in the course. Public computer conferences, on the other hand, were used for more formal types of academic discourse. Quantitative comparisons of public and private texts revealed that learners wrote longer, more sophisticated and academically rich messages when contributing to the public, class-wide conferences. In comparison, private messages between individuals contained simpler sentences, were easier to read, and were more likely to use jargon. The two forms of communication appeared to serve different purposes. It is proposed that private messaging may help foster a sense of mutual trust among students, which may, in turn, be a necessary precursor to community-building.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:46Z (GMT).

To understand knowledge construction and learning within online help forums, this study examined the interactional dynamics amongst help-givers (experts) and help-seekers (newcomers) in an open, voluntary help forum for Java computer programming language. A purposive sample of active threads was analyzed using a coding scheme adapted from the argumentative knowledge construction (AKC) framework. The study found that while help-givers actively engaged in advanced argumentative and social moves, help-seekers seldom did. Furthermore, the number of advanced epistemic messages was lower than expected and both help-givers and help-seekers often veered off-topic towards socialization and conflict-oriented interactions. The study questions the feasibility of online help forums for facilitating acquisition of domain-specific knowledge by help-seekers but demonstrates the viability of the platform as a mechanism for experts to expand their knowledge. Our findings suggest that those who know more are able to learn more given their ability to engage in argumentation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this paper, a group of five high school students is studied as they engage in a learning by design task to design an educational resource about a local waterway. They carried out this design work in The Design Studio at the University of Sydney, using an iPad projected onto a whiteboard wall. Multiple streams of data were collected, visualized and analyzed, which allowed the overall patterns of tool use for all members of the group to be identified in relation to the development of their design. Two patterns of tool use are identified and analyzed according to the practice of sketching identified in other fields of design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:47Z (GMT).

Especially, the focus was on exploring what ""I-positions"" the students constructed, and how different ""voices"" encountered in the students' discourse. The subjects, 11 health education students, attended an online course on the philosophy of science in the context of higher education. In order to study students' internal and external dialogue in terms of analyzing multivoicedness in their sense making process, a discourse analysis was used. Results showed that by reflecting their experiences in the light of different scientific approaches the students became aware of the different voices that underlie their thinking and activities and seemed to cause tensions in their professional positioning. This resulted in refining, strengthening and re-constructing their professional and scientific I-positions, and constructing a We-position.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:48Z (GMT).

This investigation traces the development of ideas within a group of five students engaged in a collaborative design process. Tasked with the design of an online educational resource, about a waterway of local significance, this group was one of three for which multiple streams of data (audio and video) were collected. Ideas central to the progression of their design were identified and represented visually over time, showing the impact of each group member and the facilitator, and discourse was coded according to the content code of the CPACS scheme. Four phases of design were identified and Markov- transition diagrams of the content were interrogated. This paper makes a contribution to our knowledge of the phases of design evident during LBD tasks, which could have implications for the design and management of such projects in the future.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:49Z (GMT).

The way in which this public knowledge is exploited individually to construct a conceptualization of the problem is examined here. The paper presents a microanalysis of a collaborative case-centered learning dialogue between three learners where a novel conceptualization is constructed re-using selected surface and structural elements contained in a prior conceptualization. How the novel conceptualization is constructed is shown by tracing surface and structural knowledge in the sequence of contributions and by identifying the point-of-view adopted by the learners. We argue that a mechanism of individualistic appropriation accounts for this construction, and this mechanism may be central in collaborative learning. This entails a revision of the notion of co- construction in collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:49Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

These forums offer affordable, accessible, and efficient help as a social, public endeavor. Some forums exhibit a strong sense of virtual community, especially amongst well-established helpers who are core participants. To investigate how newcomers may enter into such a community, five helpers were recruited to participate for eight consecutive weeks in an existing popular forum for mathematics homework help covering arithmetic through advanced mathematics. We modified a virtual community framework to describe the activity of the newcomer helper who made the most progress in moving from peripheral to fuller participation in terms of membership, influence, and immersion. This process involved cultivating a sense of belonging and building supportive relationships, contributing meaningfully and creating a voice, and demonstrating dedication to shared goals.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:50Z (GMT).

Two dimensions were used for coding: focus (what the intervention is aimed at) and means (how the teacher intervenes). Teacher behavior was studied for a period of several weeks. Our results indicate that both focus and means changed as time progressed, and that type of interventions varied between groups. Characterizing teacher behavior as a particular type, as done in other research, is therefore refuted. Conclusions that hold for the whole of the studied period are that number of teacher interventions was related to amount of student activity, and that the teacher focused more on task content than group collaboration. In the discussion suggestions are given for teacher supporting tools.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We present process measures from a 2x2-factorial experiment with the factors CSCL script and heuristic worked examples conducted with N=101 prospective math teacher students. Results show that both means of instructional support induced transactive argumentation in the collaborative learning process. The self-generated transactive argumentation, but not the partner-generated transactive argumentation mediated the effects of both types of instructional support on students' development of argumentation knowledge. Nevertheless, the learning partners mutually influenced their transactive argumentation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:51Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Ten variables indexing four dimensions of students' listening (breadth, depth, temporal contiguity and revisitation) and five variables indexing three dimensions of students' speaking (discursiveness, depth of content and reflectivity) were calculated for 31 students participating in six week-long online discussions as part of an undergraduate educational psychology course. Multi-level mixed-model linear regressions indicated that responsiveness of students' posts was positively predicted by how often they revisited previously read peer posts, and negatively related to a greater number of posts in the discussion overall. Post content quality was predicted by the percentage of posts viewed that students actually read (as opposed to scan). Put together, results suggest that when students take the time to read and re-read their peers' posts there are related benefits in the quality of the posts they contribute.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:51Z (GMT).

However, research on the relationship between epistemological beliefs, motivation, and student learning in online settings has been under-studied and under-theorized. This study investigated the relationships among epistemological beliefs, achievement goals, and learning performance in online discussions. 124 students participated in discussion activities in an online instructional technology course. The results from correlation analysis and structural equation modeling indicate that epistemological beliefs have significant effects on students' learning performance, through the mediation of achievement goals.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:52Z (GMT).

Design-based research (DBR) that invites children to share in the process of designing the technologies that support their learning is a natural extension of this participatory cultures movement. In this symposium, we establish a rationale for using Participatory Design (PD) techniques that can inform and enrich the process of designing technologies that support collaborative learning. We provide empirical examples from our own research of the ways in which PD can be incorporated into learner- centered technology designs. Our experiences demonstrate that PD is not only a key contributor in the design of learning technologies themselves, it can also be valuable resource that sheds light on the learning processes of the children who use them.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:53Z (GMT).

They will address a range of theories and methodologies to identify and approach the major aspects of learning and knowledge development in the informal context of the present-day social web. The presenters will ground the analyses of mass collaboration processes and outcomes on a variety of examples of effective Web 2.0 settings and technological environments. The anticipated discussion will map out what unique insights can be gained from studying this form of collaboration compared to more formalized small-scale settings, as well as possible directions for future research in the area.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:53Z (GMT).

The goals of this symposium are, first, to present recent advances in theorizing guidance from a scripting and orchestration perspective, and, second, to discuss commonalities, differences and future trajectories for theory develop- ment on guidance for CSCL. The audience will be interactively involved by using technolo- gies for knowledge building. These technologies allow the audience to contribute challenging cases, questions, and ideas for studies during and after the presentations via laptops and smart phones.

There are many examples of successful implementation of collaborative, knowledge-construction oriented pedagogies using socio-cognitive and socio-metacognitive tools in formal and informal educational settings as well as in teacher professional development. However, there are many challenges to scaling up such innovations beyond small-scale implementation, including that of developing into ""fatal mutations"" (Brown, 1992).

Sixty four middle school children, with a high percentage of Native American and Hispanic students, participated in a six-week mathematics game design program. Data were collected via in-field observation, design interaction analysis, interviewing, and an attitudes survey. The findings indicated that the design-based interaction and programming-oriented problem solving processes embodied mathematical thinking and reinforced positive attitudes toward mathematics. On the other hand, the prioritization of world/character design and the cognitive demand of computational programming led to a superficial integration or representation of mathematics in children's design products.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:55Z (GMT).

It builds on existing systems for collaborative argumentation and automated assessment of collaborative learning to achieve assessment for learning and to realize it in authentic classroom environments. We illustrate the framework by instantiating it in the conceptual design of one such system for use in schools.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:56Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

If there is expertise on collaboration the retrieval of rich internal collaboration scripts should be differentiable from the retrieval novices' scripts. In two studies collaborative experts and novices of the domains academia and medicine were confronted with stimuli, in which people were involved in, sometimes technology-supported, collaborative activities. To test for domain-specifity stimuli differed regarding the same vs other domain as the subject. The answers were subsequently coded. There is evidence for expertise on collaboration as the results show that experts retrieve more script-like information overall.

A quantitative descriptive analysis has been conducted on the markers used and on the reflective categories of the sentences in the reports. Results show that students (1) paid more attention in repairing their relationship than reflecting on learning and task goals; (2) used mainly positive markers to both reflect in and on action; (3) used more their partner's markers in the second reports; (4) reflected more on themselves in the second reports to justify successes and failures, and to express satisfaction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:57Z (GMT).

This article reports on a laboratory experiment that investigates how the design of an awareness tool impacts the navigation behavior of recipients within an online discussion forum. In the experiment, 127 participants read through a forum discussion for which posts were rated by average agreement and average quality. Depending on the experimental condition, posts were visualized along continua indicating average agreement ratings (absent vs. present) and/or average quality ratings (absent vs. present). It was hypothesized that an agreement visualization will increase the salience of both high- agreement and low-agreement posts, whereas a quality visualization will only increase the salience of high-quality posts. Measuring reading times for discussion posts, these hypotheses could be confirmed. However, neither recipients' attitude strength nor recall of discussion arguments was affected.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, how knowledge builders work together on their respective ideas and on external authoritative resources is understudied, especially in the social sciences when distinguishing advances made in the development of diverse ideas on a specific topic is a highly complex process for knowledge builders. Instead of using the conceptual inquiry thread as the unit of analysis, this study explores the responsive engagement of knowledge builders in each thread in order to reveal how achievement of deeper levels of knowledge advancement either were, or failed to be, achieved. In other words, the communal growth will be examined by evidence of authentic exchanges among knowledge builders. Results indicate that revised ideas were productive but knowledge building tended to remain incompatible with them. Possible explanations for the reluctance to incorporate idea improvement in social sciences are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:52:59Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We consider how expanding connective ethnography may meet researchers' needs in online contexts and we raise questions about how participants learn in these settings.

A study was conducted in a grade 3 classroom to foster sustained knowledge building through ITM-aided collaborative reflection. Analyses of online discourse, classroom videos, ITM data, and student interviews elaborate the processes and benefits of ITM-aided reflection to foster student awareness of their collective knowledge and collaborative, sustained efforts to advance it.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:53:01Z (GMT).

Yet, little is known about how different synchronous communication modalities influence students' perceptions of social presence in learning settings. Existing laboratory research indicates that social presence is negatively affected when communication cues are reduced to text. Using a within-subject design, we investigated whether differences in communication modality (1. chat, 2. audio, and 3. audio-video) affect social presence and motivation in a blended learning seminar. Results show in contrast to laboratory findings that communication modality did not directly affect students' perceptions of social presence. Instead, expertise in computer-mediated communication (CMC) appeared as important moderating variable that facilitated the perception of social presence as well as motivation in the chat modality more strongly than in audio or audio-video. Current results provide new insights and practical implications for online learning settings that use synchronous CMC.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:53:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Research has indicated positive impact of shared artifacts or reference objects such as video records of teaching practice on the quality of teachers' conversations in both face-to- face and online discussions. Our earlier studies also show that embedding animated classroom episodes as reference objects into virtual discussion spaces can help teachers produce highly meaningful and in-depth conversations about teaching practice. Yet, all moments in a video or animation are not created equal and it is important to understand whether particular moments (reference points) included in a single reference object attract more attention than others as subjects of conversation. While this issue has been studied in the context of analyzing face-to- face conversations among teachers, we have not come across studies that examine the connection between particular reference points and the quality of online postings referring to those. This paper reports on a preliminary study that indicates promising results of how reference points can help improve the quality of teachers' online discussions. For example, teachers made more evaluative comments and proposed more alternative moves of teaching when they referred to reference points than when they did not refer to reference points. This kind of studies are important because they can help the course designer better design or select shared artifacts to facilitate and stimulate group conversations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:53:03Z (GMT).

Mobile devices, such as smartphones and media players, can provide a much needed technical infrastructure for linking the mathematics of school with students' lives and experiences outside of school. In support of this claim, we present results from a study where students used mobile devices to engage in mathematical problem solving, with problems drawn in part from their out-of-school interests and experiences. Findings suggest that mobile devices, properly deployed, can help provide ease the process of making connections between the informal competencies that students bring with them to school, and the disciplinary competencies that schools most hope to foster.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:53:03Z (GMT).

We propose a study of the participation of undergraduate students in computer science to a CSCL experiment in order to detect possible differences between female and male students. Moreover, we have tried to determine if the composition of the groups influences the value of the factors proposed for analyzing the activity of a student. The factors used for analysis are qualitative heuristics used to determine the activity of the users with regard to both involvement and content. Thus, we have been able to identify differences between the knowledge, innovation, involvement and vocabulary manifested by each gender group in several cases: chats only with males, with a majority of males or females and with an equal distribution of genders. The main conclusions of the research are that females are innovative and that equally distributed groups have higher scores than the others for several indicators.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-01-08T18:53:04Z (GMT).
