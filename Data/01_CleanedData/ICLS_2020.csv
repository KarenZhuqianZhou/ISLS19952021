In this paper, we investigate whether this approach can be effectively deployed in an intelligent tutoring system, which affords the opportunity to automatically generate and adapt problem content for practice and assessment purposes. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare students who practiced problems based on a single template to students who practiced problems based on multiple templates within the same intelligent tutoring system. No conclusive evidence was found for differences in the two conditions on students’ post-test performance and hint request behavior. However, students who saw multiple templates spent more time answering practice items compared to students who solved problems of a single structure, making the same degree of progress but taking longer to do so.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:55Z (GMT).

There is a substantial and growing body of work under the learning analytics banner.  Much of it framed technically around data harvested from digital tools and presentation mechanisms called dashboards.  Using a specific case involving a collaborative game-based education research project, this paper provides a broad, sociotechnical design perspective through three frame expanding sections: the educational game’s learning theory-driven approach, the information architecture of the learning analytics system, and the activity system that the information from learning analytics information are used within.  This paper illustrates a portion of the conceptual landscape that can guide the design, development, and research for these data systems that are potentially consequential for students and educators.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:56Z (GMT).

Video data was coded for cognitive engagement with various scientific ideas about states of matter, and interaction analysis (IA) was used to explore the socioemotional dynamics of classroom interactions that supported and/or hindered this cognitive engagement.

We analyzed each video to understand pairs’ debugging strategies and practices in navigating the multi-representational problem space. Our findings reveal the importance of employing system-level strategies while debugging physical computing systems, and of coordinating between various components of physical computing systems, for instance between the physical artifact, representations on paper, and the onscreen programming environment.

Critical reading of historical texts in particular helps bridge the gap between seeing history as memorization-oriented and seeing it as an inquiry-oriented discipline that reconstructs narrative and context. Net.Create is an open-source, network-analysis software tool paired with activities that support intuitive creation and revision of a network data set and accompanying visualization, and through these representational practices, reading comprehension in humanities classrooms. Findings show that as students draw on details in a historical text to collaboratively construct a larger network, they begin to emphasize context reconstruction over memorization.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:57Z (GMT).

I present two investigations that leveraged Knowledge-in-Pieces approaches to add theoretical specificity to characterizing the challenges and opportunities undergraduate biology students experience when coordinating knowledge of mathematical and physical models. Clinical interviews demonstrated that students do use knowledge of equations to dynamically assemble an intuitive but productive understanding of physical quantities. Moreover, student reasoning stabilized around the equation. Think-aloud protocols illustrated that using a multi-representational learning technology (NetLogo) to problematize students’ reasoning de-stabilized their knowledge to shift them towards constructing the productive understanding and conferred a learning benefit on a multi-representational assessment. These investigations illustrate that Knowledge-in-Pieces approaches can inform the design of undergraduate biology education learning environments that aim to use mathematical representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:57Z (GMT).

To address this oversight, we use this paper to explore the following research questions: To what extent do the musicological critiques of SMN apply to qualitative research? And how can qualitative researchers address these critiques? In response, we begin by drawing parallels between experimental music literature and posthuman education scholarship, arguing that SMN limits the scope of qualitative inquiry and reinscribes the problematically humanist aims of education research. We then propose the use of graphic scores as a means to explore how sound and other non-anthropocentric bodies contribute to the construction of meaning within learning environments. To exemplify this approach, we conclude by providing two graphic score transcriptions of video data.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:57Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We present the process of developing a tool that assesses collaboration quality based on behavioral communication at individual and group levels. The assessment tool uses behavior analytics comprised of multistage machine learning models built on an intricate collaboration conceptual model and coding scheme. Our collaboration conceptual model shows how layers of behavioral cues contribute to collaboration and serves as the foundation of an automated assessment tool for collaboration. We present initial findings that show reliability between our assessment of behavioral interactions with and without speech. An automated collaboration assessment tool will give teachers information about student collaboration and help inform instruction that will guide and support students’ collaboration skill development.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:58Z (GMT).

New and affordable educational technologies (e.g., motion-based technologies, AR, VR) enable researchers and practitioners to include more gestures and body movements into their learning designs. Yet, while technology-enhanced embodied learning shows positive results during controlled trials in laboratory settings or one-to-one interventions in special classrooms or units, findings are dissimilar when relevant implementations are conducted in mainstream school classrooms. This paper presents the first stage of a design-based research study aiming at implementing an orchestration strategy for technology-enhanced embodied learning, guided by an already published conceptual framework on classroom orchestration. With this study we aim to spark the dialog on classroom orchestration strategies for the successful enactment of technology-enhanced embodied learning in the classroom, highlighting the essential need to consider learning design as it is not a simple process to shift laboratory success to real world learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:58Z (GMT).

SMM is embedded in a tablet-based app called Visitracker used to collect data in museums through surveys and timing and tracking of visitors’ interactions. For SMM, visitors are invited to recount their experience in a museum room verbally and visually by marking it on an illustrated floor plan displayed on the tablet along with digital paint tools. The app records both visitors’ talk and their markings. This paper discusses SMM and its methodological contribution to exploring aspects of the museum experience by drawing upon data from a collaborative study at the Austrian Gallery Belvedere. The findings suggest that SMM enables researchers to capture aspects of visitors’ previous experience and knowledge which become relevant in interaction with the physical and social context of their visit.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:58Z (GMT).

However, there is very little clarity regarding the process of estimation problem solving. We need to understand the processes underlying good estimation performance before we design teaching-learning strategies for estimation. In this paper, we report on the second iteration of a design-based research project to understand and support estimation problem solving among engineering undergraduates. We designed a software environment with several resources and scaffolds for solving estimation problems. By analyzing student actions as they solve an estimation problem in this environment, we identified the problem-solving processes that lead to good estimation performance. We found that good estimators built models using a simulator, conceptual knowledge and disciplinary reasoning, and performed frequent evaluation and planning. These findings have implications for the teaching and learning of estimation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Yet, the nature of such struggle is uncomfortable in the moment and often avoided for some students. This study aims to interrogate the phenomenon of learning through a lens of perseverance by investigating the effect of scaffolding mathematics tasks on students’ perseverance process during problem-solving. The findings illustrate that prompting students to conceptualize a mathematical situation prior to problem-solving can encourage re-initiating and re-sustaining mathematically productive effort upon reaching a perceived impasse, despite reported discomfort. These results suggest specific methods by which in-the-moment perseverance, and thus learning mathematics with understanding, can be supported.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:28:58Z (GMT).

This interdisciplinary work presents an explainable AI prototype with visualized explanations as feedback for computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). This research study seeks to provide interpretable insights with machine learning technologies for multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) by introducing two different explanatory machine learning-based models (neural network and Bayesian network) in different manners (end-to-end learning and probabilistic analysis) and for the same goal - provide explainable and actionable feedback. The prototype is applied to the real-world collaborative learning scenario with data-driven learning based on sensor-data from multiple modalities which can assess collaborative learning processes and render explanatory real-time feedback.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:00Z (GMT).

Previous approaches to CS identity have mostly focused on getting students to reveal their identifications in the form of drawings or survey responses. More recent approaches have started to examine narratives, positionings and critical engagement in a field that historically has marginalized large groups of people, especially women and students of color. In this paper, we chart and review this “identity turn” in CS education by drawing on metaphors developed in STEM and literacy studies to review how identity has been framed and researched. In the discussion, we address how a focus on learner identities with computing can contribute towards promoting a richer and more critical understanding of learning and teaching in K-12 CS education.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:00Z (GMT).

Using such learning environments, when students construct knowledge about disciplinary ideas using inquiry practices, it is important that they make connections between the two. We call such connections epistemic connections, which are about constructing knowledge using science inquiry practices. In this paper, we discuss the design of a computational thinking integrated biology unit as an Emergent Systems Microworlds (ESM) based curriculum. Using Epistemic Network Analysis, we investigate how the design of unit support students’ learning through making epistemic connections. We also analyze the teacher’s pedagogical moves to scaffold making such connections. This work implies that to support students’ epistemic connections between science inquiry practices and disciplinary ideas, it is critical to design restructured learning environments like ESMs, aligned curricular activities and provide appropriate pedagogical scaffolds.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:00Z (GMT).

Effective iteration helps DBR teams understand stakeholder goals and quickly reject both designs stakeholders do not want and less impactful theory. However, we in the learning sciences have not defined the logic of iteration in DBR, specifically: (1) What are the core elements of iteration?  (2) When should DBR teams iterate? (3) If DBR teams aim to iterate rapidly, how can they organize DBR to do so? (4) How can teams choose their focus when they iterate? We propose four key principles that make up the logic of iteration in DBR: (1) Building-testing cycles, (2) iterating early and frequently, (3) slicing, and (4) risking. This paper helps us organize DBR projects and train learning scientists to better support stakeholder goals, develop more impactful theory, and positively impact policy and practice.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:00Z (GMT).

Studies often focus on the representation of one attribute, although social media environments such as wikis may benefit from GA combinations. In our studies, we examined the importance of cognitive (knowledge), behavioral (participation), and emotional (friendliness) GA information in wiki article selections, which allows initial predictions about how individuals deal with combined GA information. A quantitative analysis using choice-based conjoint analysis (N = 104) showed that the visualization of friendliness is weighted higher than participation in wiki groups. GA assessments are moreover slightly related to personal characteristics like the learning motivation, the tendency towards social comparisons, and the need for affect. The additional qualitative analysis (N = 19) revealed a higher effect of visualized emotional deficits on perceived group problems than cognitive and behavioral deficits, underlining the need for a stronger investigation and support of emotional GA.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:01Z (GMT).

The course was designed to foster perspective-taking in the student players, and thus help them connect to and more deeply appreciate the historical content being studied. This study looks at five perspectives students could assume which were identified by the course instructor as goals of the course: the perspective of a historian, a person responding to events, a political leader, a city-state citizen, a Greek at the time. The last three of these were identified as important historical practices that are difficult to teach in a lecture-focused classroom environment. Analysis of students’ classroom interactions and written work demonstrates that learning occurred and that students adopted the five perspectives in question. We pay special attention to the design of the game and how different design features supported perspective-taking in students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:01Z (GMT).

These mutual assistance rules give a person who has been helped by someone an obligation to help another, while, at the same time, giving a person who has assisted someone an obligation to be assisted by someone else. The authors introduced these rules into a project-based cooperative learning setting to verify their effectiveness. This experimental study, which took place in a university’s project-based learning classroom, has suggested that these rules are effective in facilitating the formation of social capital in a group of learners.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:01Z (GMT).

However, with the growth of technology in classrooms, students often find themselves working in multiple contexts (i.e., a student might work face-to-face with a peer on one task and then move to engaging in an online discussion for homework). We have created a CSCL environment that aims to support student help-giving across a variety of digital platforms. This paper describes three cycles of a design-based research study that aims to design a system to support help-giving and improve interaction quantity and quality across different contexts as well as to better understand whether students benefit by the addition of multiple contexts. The paper shares major refinements across the three cycles that worked to balance research, pedagogical, and technological goals to improve students’ help-giving behavior in a middle-school mathematics classroom.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:01Z (GMT).

Scenius suggests that we reconsider the ecology of spaces like YOUmedia that are communities of practice(s), that are social spaces, and that are spatially situated within larger institutional contexts. What I draw from scenius into the context of YOUmedia is a sense that there are agents of scenius whose hands may not be making, who hold power to support the community from the periphery, from the places and spaces in between.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:02Z (GMT).

In this paper, we present the findings of a large-scale survey (n=1,261) on informal science learning. The results show that gender and social background influence youths’ attitudes toward science as well as their engagement with informal learning. The paper concludes with a design proposal for an engagement tracker enabling young learners’ self-reflection and participation in designing their learning activities. Both elements, self-reflection and participation are meant to encourage science learning and diminish the gap between learners from diverse backgrounds.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:02Z (GMT).

We seek to identify and synthesize prior work at the intersection of narrative-based learning and educational technologies.

Collaboration agency is a property that also belongs to both individual members and the whole group, which can be empirically examined through the place making practice and mediational means. Through the analysis of a case episode, we presented the complexity of one group’s collaborative problem-solving effort and evidenced the criticality of analyzing place making practice and mediational means. This analysis helps expand our view of agency in classroom beyond the dilemma resulted from a felt need to control, or the power relations, and further bears implications for learning design practitioners.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:03Z (GMT).

At the same time, other work in computing education has pressed the field to broaden its conception of the contexts where computational thinking occurs, identifying debugging activities and practices across diverse and multi-modal settings. In resolving this productive tension between systematically describing debugging and recognizing its broad reach, we argue researchers should attend to rich descriptions of situated debugging, especially among beginning debuggers. We present data from a week-long, free summer camp, Code Your Art, that engaged middle-school students in creating expressive computational visual effects. Here we find that students’ responses to debugging tasks varied sharply across tasks. We argue that debugging work emerges in interaction with features of the environment, and we discuss design refinements we have made to pursue and study this conjecture.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:03Z (GMT).

Over the past three years we have developed and refined successive prototypes with over 500 middle school and high school students in a variety of learning spaces including schools, libraries, summer camps, and other out-of-school programs. This paper shares the current TunePad design along with data from three summer camps for middle school students that involved daily work with the platform. Through these camps we saw significant gains in learners’ attitudes around computer programming as measured through pre-post surveys. We also share a theoretical perspective on music and coding as an intersection of literacies that we reflect on through student-created artifacts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:03Z (GMT).

Design efforts were made to facilitate knowledge flows among these activities to enable collaboration across people, time, and space. Through a descriptive case study, we investigated the extent to which the KCI model was supported by the design and whether the design facilitated learning. Based on a rich dataset comprising system logs, student artifacts, and interviews, results showed with synergistic integrated support key principles of the KCI model were reflected in students’ digital traces and accounts of learning experiences.

Today scientists create computer models requiring knowledge and skill in both science and computation. Additionally, computational modeling can provide powerful opportunities for learning. Hence, there is a need within K-12 science education to teach computational modeling. However, there are many barriers to incorporating this practice into K-12 classrooms, including the difficulty of learning how to code. In this paper we present the creation of a domain-specific modeling experience with a “custom block” visual programming language for an agent-based modeling environment for high school biology students. We found that with refined language, which maintained the metaphors and the abstractions vital to the science concepts being taught, students were able to complete a computational model without having been taught how to code. We also found preliminary evidence of students being able to learn science through building a computational model composed of customized code blocks.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:04Z (GMT).

We share our work from an ongoing design-based research study and present two cases to illustrate how RPG Maker shapes the narratives Indigenous youth are able to share.

We analyze how the props complement and extend embodied activity as participants collectively organize, model, and discuss how water particles move during state changes. Students in a combined 1st and 2nd grade classroom (n=22) participated in a seven-day Science through Technology Enhanced Play (STEP) curriculum. We apply interaction analysis to offer a close look at how the students take up props in ways that complement their current embodied understanding of particles and extend their sensemaking to support new conceptual understandings. Findings demonstrate the potential of props as supplemental tools to support student sensemaking around challenging science concepts within MR environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:05Z (GMT).

As stories were discovered, told, collected, and shared, counter-narratives to dominant public history narratives were revealed. Analysis is focused on two iterations of a design-based research study in which high school students researched, authored and shared historical stories as they walked through city streets, curated gallery spaces and visited the museum.

The study takes place in the context of undergraduate face-to-face collaborative problem solving engineering classrooms. Students worked in small groups to solve an authentic, ill-structured engineering task. Students’ verbal interactions were analyzed in terms of collaborative, cognitive, and metacognitive dimensions. The types of interactions under each dimension were correlated with the groups’ progress on the task. Findings indicated that groups were partially engaged in high quality interactions despite the fact that the task and the technology were designed to promote the types of interactions that positively impact the group processes. Higher group progress scores were associated with more engagement in causal elaborated statements and metacognitive turns. This can inform the design of tasks, technological tools, and instructional models that are used in collaborative problem solving STEM classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:05Z (GMT).

There is a wealth of research on self-assessment, calibration, and metacognitive learning (e.g., Azevedo, 2009; Zimmerman, 2002), but there is a lack of research on calibration at the group level. To accurately calibrate, an accurate understanding of the assessment criteria plays an important role, and reflective activities in groups on self-assessment could provide opportunities for learners to take time thinking about their performance and correcting each other’s understanding of the criteria. This study aims to examine the relationship between learner calibration, at the group and individual level, with their patterns of discourse in the self-reflective discussions that indicated learner understanding of the assessed items. Results show that high calibration accuracy groups had more accurate understanding of the items, while incorrect understanding in medium and low calibration accuracy groups were either ignored or agreed upon, rather than challenged.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:06Z (GMT).

However, many messages often do not receive responses. This paper aims to understand the relationship between the characteristics of message content and the corresponding message responsiveness. We randomly sampled 140 topics from a high school mathematics online discussion forum and analysed 1,559 reply messages using multilevel logistic regressions at the topic and message level. It was found that a message that either expressed a disagreement, a correct idea or a wrong idea or asked a question was more likely to receive a response. Time was another significant predictor of a message’s responsiveness, in that messages posted earlier in a discussion or users that responded more promptly were more likely to receive a response. The findings contribute to the understanding of the discourse processes and students’ learning behaviour in online academic discussions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:06Z (GMT).

We present a microethnographic analysis of a single pedagogical activity organized around GeoMedia, a tool we designed to mimic authentic surveillance technologies currently used by numerous law enforcement agencies. Our findings detail how the organization and unfolding of learning in the focal activity created opportunities for students to explore “under the hood” of advanced technologies, and to feel a sense of excitement and awe at the possibilities and perils of social media surveillance. Additionally, our findings show how opportunities to learn were not solely constructed through apriori pedagogical design, but also emerged through in-the-moment instructional decisions and sequences of activity. This study has implications for participatory design possibilities grounded in interdisciplinary collaboration between historically disparate disciplines like computer science and civics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:06Z (GMT).

This paper identifies new ways that visitors negotiate joint attention and co-presence while making meaning inside and outside of a multisensory virtual reality museum exhibition.  The study is based on a large-scale design-based research project in which an interdisciplinary team designed and built an immersive architecture exhibition. Informed by perspectives on embodied interaction and meaning making, interaction analysis methods were applied to video data of pairs of visitors as they took turns exploring and guiding each other through the experience. Findings suggest that in situations where gaze and gesture cannot be relied on, visitors develop creative means to develop shared understandings. The study contributes to conceptions of presence in meaning making and the design of collaborative learning interactions across perceptual experiences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:06Z (GMT).

This paper examines the potential for integrating computing and literacy education through designing and implementing multimodal composition activities in a visual programming environment, Scratch. Ten primary students took part in an after-school intervention in an inner-city primary school in the midlands of England. Tasks focused on algorithm design, program execution and loops for programming, and representation choice, and structural and visual design for storytelling. Our results demonstrate how a non-STEM context supported the process of integrated programming and storytelling in meaningful ways.

Computational abstractions that become useful in the lifeworld of the classroom are steeped in the history of how those abstractions came to be used and understood. In this paper, we describe how two elementary classrooms used a programming and modeling language in ways that link their material enactments, measurements, and paper-based forms of representations to productive computational abstractions. The heterogeneity of computational abstractions––and how they came to enter the shared language within these classrooms––have implications for our understanding of how learners perceive their shared production of scientific explanations and the computational and non-computational tools they use. Findings have implications for the design of programming environments and for K12 computational modeling, both in regard to science education and computing education.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:07Z (GMT).

It examines how uncertainties are caused by pedagogy oriented by the SDL process and how students overcome uncertainties. A qualitative case study was conducted on a group of fourth graders in a self-directed STEM lesson. The STEM lesson was designed by a team of teachers from a school supported by a university-school partnership project. Data sources included videos on classroom observation, teacher interviews, student focus group interviews and artifacts generated for learning. The STEM lesson was analyzed with the scholarship of interactional ethnography. The case analysis makes visible how uncertainties and student learning emerge in the SDL process. This study contributes to explicating why uncertainties are needed for promoting SDL and how uncertainties are dynamically shaped by and shape learning contexts. Student agency is realized in this dynamic. The findings inform the science of designing learning for promoting SDL.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:07Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Pop-up programs are a kind of museum-based experience that include learning goals, yet offer flexibility based on visitors’ interests and prior knowledge. To evaluate the design of a pop-up science program, we used the Learner Centric Ecology of Resources (LCEoR) model to frame our investigation of learners’ interactions with supportive resources. We used sociocultural discourse analysis and association analysis to identify learners and useful resources, then qualitatively examined how learners related to the intended learning goals of the program (i.e., Knowledge/Curriculum) based on characteristics of their museum visit (i.e., Environment/Organization). As expected from prior research, parents and children acted as learners and resources. However, families’ experiences revealed more agency over Knowledge and Environment than indicated in the original LCEoR model. We modified our representation of the model to illustrate how museum studies can extend this learning sciences framework.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:07Z (GMT).

In the WRC, students develop conceptual and computational models of surface water runoff, then use simulations incorporating their models to develop, test, and optimize solutions to the runoff problem. We conducted a classroom pilot study where we collected students’ learning artifacts and data logged from their use of the computational environment. We illustrate opportunities students had to integrate science, engineering, and computational thinking during the unit in a pair of contrasting vignettes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:07Z (GMT).

In education, both learning and assessing CPS competency are imperatives. However, research related to CPS assessment has not been a mainstream topic in educational measurement, though there are international efforts like PISA and ATC21S initiatives, and a few assessment methodologies have been proposed. This study is an in-depth investigation to compare students’ CPS performance in a closed-ended technology-mediated and an open-ended authentic task setting. Differences in assessment results were observed, which has important implications for the design of learning and/or assessment in CPS. In the extant literature, large-scale CPS assessments deploy tightly framed, technology-mediated tasks, while CSCL research studies learning in authentic contexts. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how task contexts influence CPS behavior.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:09Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Working within a researcher-practitioner partnership, we developed activities designed to integrate CT into a fourth-grade mathematics classroom using the Sphero robot. The goal was to create activities where the mathematics served as context to employ CT strategies and the CT helped deepen mathematics engagement. Here, we present two vignettes from this work. One shows what mutually-supportive CT and mathematics can look like in a fourth-grade classroom, and a second illustrates how both CT and mathematics can be present but not mutually supportive. This work advances our understanding of what it looks like to integrate CT into mathematics in resource- and time-constrained public-school elementary classrooms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:09Z (GMT).

We then present illustrative cases from an ongoing co-design study with people with lived or professional scholarly experience of gender and sexuality-based marginalization. Our analysis reveals how participants interacted with Flocking QT Stories through turning (Ahmed, 2006) their attention toward marginalized agents, and engaging in multi-level reasoning (Hostetler, Sengupta & Hollett, 2018; Wilensky & Resnick, 1999) to make sense of the audio stories embedded in the simulation as well as the macro-level, emergent behaviors resulting from interactions between individuals (boids), and between individuals and institutions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:09Z (GMT).

As key national and state standards emphasize the importance of integrating computational thinking (CT) into STEM classrooms, careful consideration should be made on how to teach and engage students in CT in a manner that supports the development of skills that can be applied in multiple contexts. Computational modeling integrated into science classrooms may support this goal. In this paper, we adopt a preparation for future learning approach to evaluate how proficiencies in CT are learned in a computational modeling curriculum and then transferred to problem solving in a new domain.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:10Z (GMT).

We analyze student artifacts from the first (9-week) unit of this curriculum, exploring ways that students engage with three particularly challenging ideas: (a) using models to make sense of complex phenomena; (b) integrating findings from work with models across multiple (physical, diagrammatic, and computational) modes; and (c) articulating the strengths and limitations of computational modeling soon after it was introduced in the curriculum.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:10Z (GMT).

Fifty-two Grade Five students studying Human Input & Output participated and worked in 12 groups. Quantitative analysis of Knowledge Forum notes shows that students’ contribution to collective knowledge advancement significantly predicted students’ science scores. By examining analytics-based pivotal turns, centralities, and knowledge building discourse moves, this analysis reveals different patterns of knowledge building trajectories among high-, medium-, and low-contribution groups, as well as the role of Idea-Friend Maps in scaffolding collective knowledge creation. We also examined how students co-designed and used the collective journey to sustain their knowledge creation, with the aid of Idea-Friend Maps.

We rely on a complexity perspective to structure learning environments that aims to expand collective learning opportunities while valuing the diversity of individual ideas. We explored how we could support learners to come up with their individual ideas on meaningful interactions in possible game systems and to collectively use mathematics to model those systems. We argue that collaborative game design provides opportunities for students to go beyond practicing computation and solving linear problems. They could develop a view of mathematics as a tool to make sense of systems, and experiment with and design new possible structures (i.e., in the modeled world of their game). Our findings highlight the importance of the classroom structures that support learners to develop shared goals while enabling them to pursue diverse paths of engagement with mathematics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:11Z (GMT).

Thirty-one Grade 9 students studying in Art and Design participated in the study using Knowledge Forum® (KF), a multi-media collaborative inquiry workspace. A key design involved the integration of online KF discourse and classroom discourse in the form of meta-reflection talk - knowledge building principles were embedded in classroom dialogue to support idea development and rise-above dialogue. Knowledge Building Discourse Explorer (KBDeX), a social network analysis tool, was used to track students’ changing collective responsibility over time. Classroom dialogue analyses identified dialogic moves into three areas including articulation and elaboration, build-on and connect, and collective reflection and idea development. Analyses illuminated how students engaged in collective meta-reflection and progressive dialogue. Implications of enriching classroom dialogue using knowledge-building perspectives involving meta-reflection and progressive dialogue are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:11Z (GMT).

The work is grounded in cultural-historical theory related to artifacts, imagination, and science representations. Participants include 7 families from two weather workshops, and data comprise families’ video and audio recordings. The findings show that prototyping artifacts  — the technological tools — materially and culturally mediated how families imagined and represented science phenomena and practices. The study contributes to understanding the role of imagination in children and families’ science learning and science representations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:12Z (GMT).

This interactive session brings together a diverse spectrum of leading STEM researchers to share how they operationalize CT, what integrated CT and STEM learning looks like in their curriculum, and how this learning is measured. It will serve as a rich opportunity for discussion to help advance the state of the field of STEM and CT integration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:13Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Multiple efforts have been conducted to design and study three-dimensional assessments in K-12 science classrooms; yet these projects have employed different approaches while generating different guidelines and tools. This symposium brings together members of five research teams to reflect on the NRC criteria using examples of three-dimensional assessments. Through a collective analysis of these teams’ current design approaches, we identified six emergent criteria for three-dimensional assessment design that promote equity: (1) assessments are based on a relevant phenomenon or scenario, (2) explicitly attend to language, (3) include scaffolds to make expectations explicit for students, (4) attend to the identities of learners, (5) engage and support student sensemaking, and (6) are accompanied by tools and routines to support teacher design and enactment.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:13Z (GMT).

Despite the importance of play across the lifespan, mathematics classrooms are often spaces students feel a void of agency and enjoyment. This has strong implications for students’ sense of competence and their identities as individuals who participate in and enjoy mathematics. Thus, designing playful environments where children enjoy and participate in mathematics as a form of meaning making is a critical issue for equity in education.  By putting these four studies in conversation with one another, we hope to develop a refined understanding of how particular design decisions influence learner engagement in mathematics, with an eye towards making mathematical play more accessible both in and out of school.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:13Z (GMT).

In contrast to schools or school-adjacent spaces, museum spaces are often designed to elicit various forms of learning–including affective, embodied, cultural forms–through a variety of pathways for participation from the individuated to the collaborative. However, these design intentions around learning and participation are not always legible to a racially, culturally, and linguistically diverse group of visitors, many of whom may only visit the museum as part of a school or “formal” educational activity or on limited occasions. This runs up against the design imperatives of museums that often foreground experiences which assume visitors know or feel welcome to engage in the supported forms of participation – including traditional modes of science inquiry and/or collaboration. More recently, there has been a move across museum studies, educational research, and the learning sciences to include the kinds of experiences that many learners find more inclusive of a broader range of prior knowledges and ways of knowing and doing: including games, toys, play, and theatre. In this symposium, we will explore different ways that recent research has been reframing museum experiences towards a more inclusive focus that scaffolds complex learning, joy, and play and may have implications for learning and identity. As such, we bring together scholars who are exploring new ways to design for, study, and engage museum visitors to respect different ways of knowing, different perspectives, and different backgrounds.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:14Z (GMT).

We often talk about learning through collaboration; we rarely talk about collaboration itself as learning. Talking about collaboration as learning shifts our focus on acknowledging diverse collaborative arrangements and on the design of the learning space, activities and tools that afford opportunities for the same. Instead of viewing collaborations as a byproduct of attaining a separate outcome, valuing certain collaborative behaviors as “productive”; considering collaboration as a learning outcome allows us to recognize diversity within collaborative styles and values brought into learning spaces, and their affordances and constraints for different activities. In this symposium, we bring together different ways of collaborating, as the object to design for and learn in an environment. Synthesizing these diverse bodies of work under the umbrella of learned collaboration, enables us to identify types and patterns of collaboration, which in turn, can allow us to actively support students to ""learn to collaborate; as well as broaden perspectives of recognizing different behaviors as productive collaboration (which are often overlooked due to their lack of explicit service to other learning goals).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:14Z (GMT).

In recent years, libraries have become prominent places for designing and facilitating hands-on learning experiences. As these experiences and programs increase, there has emerged a need for assessment to communicate impacts to various stakeholders and provide useful information to practitioners to make ongoing improvements. This session brings together researchers and practitioners from four projects that are designing and using assessments within libraries. These projects highlight different tools, practices, purposes and foci for assessment. Through this session, participants will become aware of these projects, engage with the tools themselves and consider the theoretical and practical implications for the different approaches.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:14Z (GMT).

Yet, the relational, contextual, and situated nature of teacher learning raises important questions and design challenges for online environments that are often remote, decontextualized, and asynchronous. These challenges invite deeper explorations of how to leverage the affordances of online environments to design experiences that further support teacher learning. In this symposium we bring together a group of projects that engage teacher learning across subject areas and domains, and that represent a range of program formats—from MOOCs to instructional coaching models to professional learning communities. We will first discuss the rationale and outcomes of the specific design features built into each of the projects, and then draw implications for online teacher learning and professional development that cut across these projects.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:15Z (GMT).

In this symposium, we argue that the learning sciences consider data-wisdom a guiding principle for ethnographic studies of how people learn and for design-based interventions that create and study new opportunities for learning. Our field has had much to say about data, information, and knowledge. Yet the notion and utility of wisdom has yet to be thoroughly explored. As our field collectively turns our commitments from generating knowledge about learning to knowledgeably enacting change through learning, we have to rely on wisdom to ensure our research endeavors act on problems that matter toward more just, caring, and loving futures for all learners.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:15Z (GMT).

We draw on theory and approaches from making-oriented education to introduce computational tinkering in science as a construct for thinking about and designing for learning with computational tools. Across two design research cycles in high school science classrooms, we analyze episodes of student activity to understand how practices of computational tinkering might translate from informal settings to formal science classrooms to enable learners to engage in practices that reflect authentic scientific work, draw upon learner experiences, and support more equitable participation in science. Looking across both student-centered and curricula-centered science classrooms for emergent goals, rapid iteration, and noticing and reflection, we saw computational tinkering take shape during moments of play, troubleshooting and tuning, and sharing. We discuss findings and implications for practice in relation to professional science practice and goals of science education in an era of computational ascendancy.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:15Z (GMT).

Despite its importance, we lack a model for teaching learners to scope highly open-ended political projects through deliberation. We designed, implemented, and evaluated deliberation-based learning (DBL), a novel model of learning environments that combines support for iterative design and deliberation, in a university design course. We found the learning environment supported students to choose political issues, form teams, and scope detailed project proposals from scratch, by completing iterations of proposing ideas, raising questions, suggesting improvements, planning to-dos, seeking information, and updating their proposals. This study contributes DBL, a novel, empirically grounded model of learning environments for scoping design projects through deliberation, which can be further refined through multi-case studies across contexts. By understanding DBL, learning scientists can engage students in political organizing in their communities—a key to sustaining democracy.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:16Z (GMT).

Toward this end, we developed Pedagogical Affordance Analysis (PAA). PAA involves analyzing teachers’ Pedagogical Content Knowledge and/or Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge to elicit pedagogical affordances and constraints that are specific to a given instructional goal.  Information obtained through PAA can help in designing, refining, and/or evaluating instructional tools. We present a case study in which we used PAA to successfully design a visual representation for middle-school algebra. To the best of our knowledge, PAA is the only available systematic method that leverages teachers’ pedagogical knowledge in identifying pedagogical affordances and constraints.

Findings indicate that there is a large degree of overlap between the students’ understandings of the KBC approach and the existing principles; that KBC design principles are potentially broader than we were initially aware; and that the formulation of a new principle may be in order. We conclude by outlining a promising direction for future research that stands to advance the conversation surrounding KBC design principles, based on existing formulations, participants’ experiences, and in-situ observations","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:17Z (GMT).

To address this gap, our team partnered with a literacy edtech product to strengthen the implementation of these research-based design features to support the variability of leaners. To evaluate the impact of these supports for learning, we surveyed over 11,000 educators who used the product in their classrooms. Using quantitative and qualitative feedback, we found that teachers were enthusiastic about the features, reporting that they supported a variety of learners. However, many teachers were unaware that these features were available. Importantly, we shared these results with the literacy platform, to further inform its development. Survey findings support incorporating both research and user-voice into design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:18Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Interaction mechanisms included storytelling and abstraction of cross-project insights, using a tool designed to share design knowledge. Seventeen unique emergent design-principles were found to correspond with well-established STEM education design-principles, but also with new notions of learning through citizen science.

One area that is receiving growing attention is whether drawing is of value when students work with multi-representational simulations. In this paper, we report on a design-based research (DBR) project to teach intermediate-level undergraduate quantum mechanics (QM) through drawing and simulations. We articulate six distinct pedagogical roles of drawing, principles for task design and success criteria for drawing both prior to and whilst working with the simulations. This approach has been iteratively improved through three annual cycles of implementation in two universities in two different countries. Our findings illustrate a variety of theory-informed reasons to draw to learn in science and consider what scaffolding is required to help students make the best use of such an approach.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:18Z (GMT).

These findings have led some to argue for a de-emphasis on patterning, but others argue that it can support insight into a problem’s structure. We introduce a phenomenon, empirical re-conceptualization, in which learners generalize based on an empirical pattern, and then re-interpret it from a structural perspective. We elaborate this construct by providing a representative example of empirical re-conceptualization from two secondary students. Our findings indicate that developing empirical results can foster subsequent insights, which can in turn lead to justification and proof.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:19Z (GMT).

A digital formative assessment approach, which moves away from traditional assessment approaches to emphasize visual analytics, awareness, reflection and target-setting, was developed for blended learning environments. The visual analytics were based on self and peer ratings of a domain-general, four-dimensional teamwork competency measure. To evaluate the intervention, a quasi-experiment using embedded mixed methods design was carried out with 452 Grade 8 students and 26 teachers. Findings suggest that the design principles enacted were instrumental for helping students learn and reflect more about their teamwork competency. It also improved their team behaviors in a targeted manner. This intervention has challenged the boundaries of conventional schooling and traversed domains, providing a set of effective design principles for teamwork skill development.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:19Z (GMT).

Students and instructors used playdough to model three-dimensional structures encountered in the field. Survey data from students in the field supports the use of playdough as a tool for improving students’ explanations of geological phenomena and their confidence in those answers. Instructor explanations were also seen as significant supports, indicating a tie between the use of the playdough models and how they were used by the instructors in the field.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:20Z (GMT).

Using the ethnographic data collected over two years, we chose and compared two tabletop game design projects.

Our findings indicate that these two groups found the opportunities or openings to connect their designs with their interests through teacher’s questioning or in the process of co-defining the design tasks. We argue that providing design constraints, such as redesigning certain aspects of existing games, may provide opportunities for learners to create continuity between the school disciplines and their personal interests.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:20Z (GMT).

While this scholarship has made important contributions to our understanding of learning in relation to these issues, less work has addressed the limitations of design approaches in the context of educational technology. Surveying emerging literature in this area, this paper outlines three key considerations for learning scientists seeking to address issues of equity when studying, designing, and implementing technology-rich environments. These issues, taking new forms across technologies and digital media, we identify as: the Neutrality Facade, the “New” Digital Divide, and the Openness Paradox. Finally, the paper offers three directions for addressing power issues in learning environments mediated by educational technology and digital media: critical design methods, critical digital pedagogy, and critical design literacies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:21Z (GMT).

Modeled after an anthropology of learning, this analysis explores the social processes and structural arrangements by which neoliberal logics rationalize a Latina high school mathematics student becoming “undesirable”. Focusing principally on classroom-level processes, I argue the roots of undesirability were co-constructed by the curricular model, peers’ perceptions, and family circumstances. Further, that the limbs of undesirability extended past the classroom to render her class of racially minoritized students undesirable within a de facto racially tracked math program; and, her school as undesirable for its predominantly racially minoritized student population.  Using Positioning Theory in ways novel to the learning sciences, and in drawing on data collected over an academic year (fieldnotes, interviews, surveys), this analysis lays bare how undesirability is both a requirement of neoliberal mathematics learning and an emergent position for someone or something to occupy.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:21Z (GMT).

We contend that argumentation is part of scientific inquiry, where it functions not only to reduce, but also to maintain and raise uncertainties. We present an analysis of written arguments from a laboratory course designed to provide opportunities for students to encounter scientific uncertainty and illustrate how students in this course were able to engage with uncertainty to motivate, extend and deepen their scientific inquiry. We describe the features of the design that allowed for this engagement and suggest that more attention be paid to the varied roles of argumentation in scientific inquiry.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:21Z (GMT).

The redesign focuses on curricula connected to the River Trip Field Experience, a five-day rafting trip on a river that functions as a natural border with tribal lands. Taking a design-based implementation research approach, we iteratively design, implement, and evaluate culturally-centered lessons throughout the year. In this paper, we specifically present our collaborative design and implementation decisions for one shared goal: building students’ cultural awareness of others.

The model combines data and geospatial analysis with grassroots community engagement. Our approach supports a community-driven method for defining the vision of what an equitable OST learning ecosystem should look like. We share experiences with complex modeling of sociopolitical dynamics (often unrepresented in data mining and geospatial technologies) and reflect on our understanding of the “geographic expression” of socioeconomic inequities and injustices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:22Z (GMT).

Over the course of a year (and still on-going), educators, researchers and youth worked on a project they named, “Reclaiming the Science Center” because it focused on re-designing the text, images and experiences in differences spaces of the Science Center towards making visible and amplifying the lived lives and wisdom of people of Color and women. Drawing upon conceptual frameworks of social-spatial justice and social practice theories, along with longitudinal critical ethnography, we report on the co-creation of spaces, both discursive and material, for critique and imagination of spatial representation. We also describe how educators centered youth-authored material artifacts toward expanding presence. Implications for working towards social-spatial justice in science centers are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:22Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

It is therefore of great importance to review the approaches proposed for assessing student design (processes and outcomes) given the increasing focus on design in STEM curricula. We began with the goal of reviewing such approaches across 17 prominent journals that address STEM and design education. Database searches resulted in 2101 raw hits and ultimately resulted in a sample of 27 articles, predominantly in engineering education. We performed a content analysis to identify key assessment practices. The majority (20) included a focus on performance of the design, and a substantial number included a focus on communication (15) and scoping (11). While less prevalent, divergent thinking (9), creativity (9), convergent thinking (8), and collaboration (8) were also broadly represented.

In this paper, we compare two forms of exploration of time series line graphs: plan and typical. In the plan condition, students plan an experiment with a model by graphing the level of a system parameter (e.g., concentration of greenhouse gases) and the predicted response of an outcome variable (e.g., temperature). They then run the model to observe the accuracy of their predictions. In the typical condition, students run the simulation immediately and adjust the parameter level as they see fit. Students produced more informative experiments in the plan condition than the typical condition. Students in the plan condition made inferences by comparing their prediction to the outcome.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:24Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Grounded in socio-cultural theory and using ethnographic methods, we have collected and analyzed data from five studio classes encompassing architecture, industrial design, and human‐computer interaction across three universities. 0ur goal was to tease apart the knowledge and behaviors that were unique to particular disciplines from those common to all the studio classrooms. Results illuminated patterns of student/teacher interactions and classroom norms that foster the development of creative solutions and shed light on the epistemic frames that guide interactions in the studio space.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:25Z (GMT).

In particular, we focus on how a shift in activity and tools actively disrupts the students’ collaborative work by changing from a widely visible tool that can be distributed and shared to an insular tool that is designed for a single user and constrains information sharing. We argue that tools can create fractures in some groups as participants struggle to gain access to information the tool provides in alignment with goals of informal activities. We conclude with design recommendations for tools intended for use in a collaborative environment.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:26Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Yet whereas all students have the capacity for co-presence, a common focus of formal educational institutions on spoken language for interaction makes communication inaccessible to some students, thus impeding their participation in learning. As such, toward providing resources for nonverbal autistic students we must ask: How do we design for inclusive social participation of students with diverse interactional modalities? This paper outlines the development of an embodied-design solution that centers the dynamic body as the nexus of social interaction, thus reclaiming the natural versatility of multimodal interpersonal communication. The Magical Musical Mat is a domain-general platform that allows people to interact through the non-speaking modalities of touch and sound. It removes interactional asymmetry between diverse interlocutors and surfaces the basic human need and capacity to connect with one another, in school and beyond.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:26Z (GMT).

Two related-foci are unpacked:  First, we examine how youth engage in an “expanded” iterative process across the making cycle – what this expanded iterative process is, and how it takes shape as youth move from collaborative ideation through to the afterlife of a maker project. Second, by delving into “moments of expanded iterations” we examine how youth articulate ownership of their making: what that means, how and why, and the subsequent generative spaces that resulted.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:27Z (GMT).

The automated analysis was used to create an on-demand feedback tool embedded in Knowledge Forum/Idea Thread Mapper to inform student reflection on their online discourse. Research conducted in four grade 5 science classrooms tested the use of automated feedback for knowledge building. The preliminary results suggest that with the feedback, students were able to revise their notes and contribute more complex explanations as opposed to simple factual information.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:27Z (GMT).

Using a fine-grained analysis, we identify critical elements of Sage’s theory building, including moves pertaining to her initial articulation, testing, refinement and application of the model, as well as meta-knowledge about the nature of the model. We present these elements and then illustrate each using data from Sage’s construction of the zombie apocalypse model.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:27Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

By “choice” we mean that students are able to decide for themselves which investigation modules (among a curated set of options offered within the curriculum unit) to complete to advance their understanding. Analysis of the combined data set (total N = 661) revealed a significant difference in overall pre-to-post learning gains in favor of students in the choice condition (compared to students in the no-choice, or standard condition). Our findings provide evidence for the value of implementing student choice compared to typical instruction that assigns students to learning activities in a predetermined sequence regardless of learner preference or interest.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:28Z (GMT).

In these studies, discussion teams in an online course are provided with open-ended discussion questions about course content to discuss. Then, individuals score the quality of the team’s collaborative processes on six items, followed by entire team reviewing their scores and devising a plan for improvement. In this paper, we examine the relationship between team reflective accuracy, collaborative sense-making, and collaborative process quality for 12 teams over five time points. Findings show a significant correlation between the reflective accuracy and collaborative process quality. A further comparative case analysis shows the underlying patterns of collaborative sense-making and reflective accuracy that impact team process quality.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:28Z (GMT).

It operationalizes the concept of ‘citizen inquiry’, that is the fusion of citizen science and inquiry-based learning. It enables members of the public to join or set up their own investigations or ‘missions’ to explore themselves and their environment. Each mission involves finding out about how CS works at scale and gaining insight into current issues such as personal wellbeing. An example of an nQuire mission is Gardenwatch; this is a survey of UK private gardens, produced by BBC Springwatch and the British Trust for Ornithology. Over 200,000 people completed surveys of their gardens on nQuire, as well as sharing their findings on social media. We are now researching how to capture and improve the impact of nQuire on citizens’ learning and engagement.

This poster investigates the utility of eye-tracking data in detecting students’ mathematics misconceptions within a digital learning environment (ST Math) to explore how their eye movement patterns may be indicative of mathematics misconceptions. Cognitive lab video recordings were used to help identify various types of misconceptions. And students’ eye tracking data were analyzed for common visual attention patterns. The findings from heat maps and gaze plots showed correspondence of a specific visual attention pattern to a specific misconception group, demonstrating the potential of diagnosing students’ mathematics conceptual understanding using eye tracking evidence.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:32Z (GMT).

We use the case of a high school geometry student to investigate two research questions: (1) How do embodied processes facilitate mathematical learning? (2) How can generalized mathematical truths be manifest through embodied processes that are grounded in particular movements? To engage the body, researchers developed a motion-capture video game, The Hidden Village, designed to elicit physical movement via in-game directed actions. In-game interactions complement logic and verbal forms of reasoning by promoting simulated actions, which are shown to recur during the student’s proof and justification. Embodied theories of learning offer insights into how learners recruit body-based resources to foster meaning-making and generalization. Embodiment also offers new insights into recharacterizing mathematics curricula in terms of movement, and the promise of new forms of embodied learning technologies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:34Z (GMT).

The use of systems thinking (ST) and computational thinking (CT) can help elucidate these problems and bring us closer to a possible solution. The construction and use of models is one of the most widely used tools when trying to understand systems. In this paper, we examine four case studies of student pairs who were engaged in building and using system models in an NGSS-aligned project-based learning unit on chemical kinetics. Using a theoretical framework that describes how CT and ST practices are manifested in the modeling process we examine the progression of students’ models during their model revisions and explore strategies they employ to overcome modeling challenges they face. We discuss some suggestions to scaffold students’ progression in constructing computational system models and prepare teachers to support their students in engaging in CT and ST practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:46Z (GMT).

Findings indicate that the teacher-coach interactions included talk at three altitudes: within, across, and beyond moments of the lesson. Additionally, collaborative sensemaking happened briefly during the lesson, but was more extended at the end of the lesson. These findings show how side-by-side coaching can provide opportunities for collective sensemaking and point to its potential rhythms across a lesson.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:46Z (GMT).

This study investigates whether online PD can achieve the same impact for high school biology teachers and students using computer-supported complex systems curriculum and instruction. We articulate changes in design decisions to accommodate the online mode and measure impact on teachers’ perceptions of their experiences and student outcomes. The results show positive teacher perceptions in both PD formats and roughly equal student outcomes.

However, there is still much to be learned about the interplay between teachers’ contexts, their perceptions of reform, and their instructional decision-making within science education. This paper utilizes conceptual tools from organizational theory to understand this interplay for two teachers working within the same middle school, adopting instructional practices associated with the Framework for K-12 Science Education. While on the surface, both teachers had similar personal, social, and organizational resources for their sensemaking and a shared commitment to integrating reform, only one implemented Framework practices, while the other maintained more traditional approaches. This analysis demonstrates ambiguity as a key differentiator in teachers’ sensemaking and enactment of reform. Ambiguity close to practice served as a catalyst for noticing and enacting instructional change.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:47Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

When students spontaneously come up with hypothetical mechanisms to explain why a lightbulb in an electric circuit does or does not light, the teacher, following the guidance of curricula, redirects them to pattern-seeking. We argue that the bias toward pattern-seeking in Chinese national standards and curricula, combined with students’ ability and propensity to propose at least the seeds of mechanistic explanations, helps explain the classroom tension between pattern-seeking and mechanism reasoning. In discussion, we extend the argument to show a less severe but similar bias toward pattern-seeking in the United States’ Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:47Z (GMT).

By doing so, we address two challenges for research of teaching and learning: (1) the under-conceptualization of the teacher role during students’ groupwork; and (2) the need to explicate the connection between teaching and learning. We suggest that, to connect student learning to teacher monitoring practices, it is valuable to link two different scales of analysis: (1) between-groups teacher groupwork monitoring routines; and (2) within-groups interactions with and without the teacher. We argue that such methodology affords a generative discussion of teachers’ instructional practices and their disruption or reproduction of exclusionary aspects of students’ conversations. To illustrate our approach, we look at two teachers. First, we describe and compare their groupwork monitoring routines. Then, we look at students’ conversations within those classrooms and discuss connections between these conversations and instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:48Z (GMT).

Using evidence from two pilot years of the Dynamic Learning Project, an instructional technology coaching program in 108 schools nationwide, our study examines and explores the attributes that teachers, principals, and coaches report contribute to the effectiveness of coaching for improving teacher use of technology in their practice. Findings suggest that a successful instructional technology coaching program is a sustained, job-embedded PD, structured around a partnership between school administrator, teacher and coach. In a successful program, teachers collaborate voluntarily with coaches who provide personalized support in a non-evaluative manner.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:48Z (GMT).

In this study, we investigate three teachers working with the same instructional materials designed to support student agency and examine variations in how they navigate these tensions.

Enacting rigorous and equitable science teaching within urban schools serving low income families of color can be difficult for novice teachers. Our perspective on social justice science teaching relies on centering students’ lives, histories, and experiences where teachers use a subset of instructional practices that support students’ learning and participation in rigorous science instruction and create equitable access to science content for all students. We analyzed classroom observation ratings and video recordings of classroom teaching in order to understand novice teachers’ development as social justice science educators. We found evidence that teachers improved over time in their efforts to use specific instructional strategies to enact social justice science teaching. In addition, there remain a few learning challenges, especially around centering students’ lived experiences, histories, and assets.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:49Z (GMT).

Seven secondary science teachers completed a year-long professional learning program on using the CQMAA with argument pedagogy. Participants designed and implemented three argument-based lessons. We surveyed (pre/post) teacher and student confidence with using argument pedagogy; students also completed a test assessing their use of critical questions (CQs). We found improvements in teacher and student confidence, and students also became better at critiquing premises (especially analogies). Results regarding evidence critiques and considering alternative explanations were mixed. Also, the teachers reported that the critical questions (CQs) deepened students’ reasoning, but some CQs were more useful than others. The research suggests that developing teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge regarding scientific argumentation is a lengthy process, and that more (video) examples of expert teachers using argument pedagogy are needed, but the CQs are useful tools for both teachers and students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:49Z (GMT).

Studies of professional science describe convergence research at the frontiers of emerging disciplines (e.g., Chandrasekharan & Nersessian, 2017; Fox Keller, 2003). These fields address problems that demand hybrid representations, which materially integrate multiple models to compose model systems, offering perspectives on large complex systems. We argue that habits-of-mind that support hybridization exist not only in professional labs but also in classrooms; we demonstrate that 6th grade students recognize the need for hybrid model systems to explain complex phenomena. Like researchers, students justify the need for hybrid models in relation to sometimes-conflicting commitments and constraints. In this context, we find that students hybridize models narratively and rhetorically, a resource for convergence thinking and a precursor to material hybridization.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:49Z (GMT).

The Projective Reflection theoretical framework structured assessment of virtual and classroom data for 54 middle schoolers in a local science museum. Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) was used to visualize different processes of identity exploration enacted by each session. Epistemic networks of class data by time period illustrated similar trajectories of identity exploration across sessions as an increase in personal interest and valuing of the domain over time, while paired-sample t-tests found chronological differences to be statistically significant across all sessions. Results illustrate ways in which virtual learning environments can support identity exploration and the potential future acquisition of science careers. The utility of ENA for visualizing identity exploration trajectories is also demonstrated.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, dynamics between veteran and novice teachers may constrain the group's reflective inquiry and, consequently, its learning. In this case-study, we explore the dynamics between veteran and novice teachers in a collaborative planning session and their implications for the group’s reflective inquiry. We use linguistic ethnographic microanalysis methods to investigate how face management in this session intertwined with teachers’ learning. We demonstrate how in a collaborative planning context, mentoring relationships can reduce face threat and thus support learning for both novice and veteran teachers. The study highlights the unique affordances of collaborative planning for reflective inquiry, advancing our understanding of the social dimensions of teachers' learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:51Z (GMT).

This paper reports on one case from a design-based study aimed at supporting beginning elementary school teachers toward ambitious and equitable mathematics teaching. I investigate the experience of Marie as she attempted to enact her commitments to building an asset-based classroom math community while immersed in a school context focused on identifying and fixing students’ individual mathematical deficits. Findings indicate that though Marie remained committed to this vision, her learning was heavily constrained by her school activity system, resulting in a steep personal cost for Marie. This case has implications for the analysis and design of equity-oriented teacher learning across the transition into teaching.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:51Z (GMT).

Scratch Educator Meetups are focused on supporting teacher co-construction and participatory learning using a professional learning community approach. Previous literature on teacher professional development suggests that professional learning communities play a key role in promoting instructional improvement, and that facilitators are central to this process. Following this theoretical orientation, we share an ethnographic case study that details the tensions, contradictions, and possibilities that can arise when a professional development facilitator eschews familiar models of supporting teacher learning in favor of a novel approach. We argue that implementing instructional improvement initiatives demands careful attention to the qualitative dimensions of change, change that occurs as facilitators learn to think and act in new ways.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:51Z (GMT).

Most research into the role of representations in supporting learning has focused on with less attention to how teachers understand representations and their use in classroom instruction. To better understand how teachers use representations, we developed a new framework called Representations for Teachers as Learners (RepTaL). This study leverages the RepTaL framework to explore the multiple dimensions of teachers’ representational understanding including their understanding of representational forms, ways of including representations within science, and ideas about what aspects of phenomena students should represent. We have used this framework to analyze interviews with 6 teachers in rural schools in the midwestern United States. We present an analysis of these interviews as an illustration of both the breadth of teacher ideas about representations including some of the limitations and as an illustration of how the RepTaL framework helps to make these ideas visible.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:52Z (GMT).

Yet much remains to be learned about how teachers self-capture video from their own classrooms while teaching, which has important implications for teacher and student learning opportunities. This paper explores how in-service primary grades teachers participating in a professional learning course self-captured video that specifically centered student thinking. Drawing on the theoretical lens of professional vision (Goodwin, 1994), we asked what teachers highlighted as salient for seeing student thinking when self-capturing, and how they orchestrated their recording and classroom activity in service of this seeing. Analyses demonstrate shifts over time in the windows teachers highlighted for seeing student thinking in video and depict the substantial orchestration work teachers engaged in to facilitate both accessing and enhancing student thinking within self-captured video.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:52Z (GMT).

However, we know less about how to support teachers in integrating CT into their classrooms. This paper presents a case of one science teacher over three years as she participated in a Design Based Implementation Research project focused on integrating CT into science curriculum. We analyze her professional growth as a designer and instructor as she created and implemented three computationally-enriched science units with the support of our research team. Results suggest that she became more confident in her understanding of and ability, leading to greater integration of CT in the science units. Relationships with the research team and co-design experiences mediated this growth. Findings yield implications for how best to support teachers in collaborative curriculum design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:52Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This study examined the range of conceptualizations and related instructional strategies employed to foster reflective learning in preservice teacher education. Thirty-two articles, which were selected based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, were reviewed. Four different categories of conceptions of reflection were identified. The review also indicated instructional strategies designed to foster reflection that include evaluation of practice, meta-reflection, identifying critical incidents, conceptual argument, and experience sharing. Despite the variety of conceptions and instructional strategies, however, preservice teachers were provided with limited opportunities of reflecting on their beliefs, values and personal experiences. Also, there were seldom opportunities for reflection beyond classroom context such as everyday life and a larger socio-cultural context.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:53Z (GMT).

We particularly focus on the relative advantages and limitations of three teacher team activity types: video analysis, peer consultation and pedagogical planning. Fifty-four transcribed teacher-meeting excerpts were analyzed using the CLIP coding scheme for teacher collaborative inquiry into practice, assessing aspects of inquiry-based reasoning, collaboration and focus on pedagogy (teacher actions, student thinking and disciplinary content). Quantitative comparisons showed that, overall, collaborative inquiry into practice was lowest during peer consultations, in part because teachers were often not positioned as agents of change in such conversations. Teachers tended to inquire into each other’s ideas more often during pedagogical planning. Surprisingly, teacher team video analysis activities were not characterized by higher measures of attention to student thinking, nor inquiry orientation. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:53Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

To date, though, research on implicit bias in education remains lab-based or not focused on processes of teaching and learning. Using a mixed methods case study design, this study investigated how ideologies of race and gender influenced Mrs. Stone’s perceptions of her Latinx students, as well as her decision-making about whether to grant them participation opportunities. Findings reveal that Latinx students were significantly marginalized in class discussions, as evidenced by quantitative analytics generated by the EQUIP observation tool (https://www.equip.ninja). Discourse analysis shows how Mrs. Stone’s description of these students as “well-behaved” and “fragile”—and her positioning of a student named Debra as a “good girl”—aligned with problematic racial and race-gender narratives about Latinx people and Latinx girls, and consequently prevented Mrs. Stone from soliciting their participation.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:53Z (GMT).

However, most studies of teaching assume a standard learning arrangement, in which the teacher is the content expert and directs student learning. What happens when this is not the case, when the resources for learning lie elsewhere (online, other students) and the expertise that the teacher brings is in how to facilitate learning rather than convey content? How do teachers navigate the role of ‘facilitator’, and what are the pedagogical best practices for doing so.

However, there is still much to learn about how debugging is learned, how it is connected to particular activities, and what seems to influence students’ strategy use and ultimate solution paths. This paper considers students’ activity on their first formal debugging task using a platform called NetLogo. Our analysis focuses on the ways that students appeared to frame the task, and how that framing influenced their overall approach to the task. Our findings suggest that it is compelling for new coders to approach debugging first by focusing on single elements of code without thinking broadly about their interactions.

However, the construction of EFL teacher identity is underresearched, particularly how teachers navigate dominant discourses around native non-native speakers. This paper presents a qualitative study examining four pre-service teachers in an EFL education program. Grounded in the community of practice identity negotiation framework, results suggest that EFL pre-service teachers’ processes of identity negotiation mainly resided somewhere between adoption and rejection of legitimate practices in the EFL teacher community, in what we call a zone of tension. The findings of this research indicate that pre-service teachers’ identity negotiation processes centered on three main notions: (1) the native speaker as a standard, (2) reflections on accents, and (3) reflections on language practices. These findings contribute to the extant conversation challenging the NS-NNS dichotomy and understanding identity as a dynamic social construct in teacher learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:54Z (GMT).

We examine data from a randomized controlled study in which teachers were randomly assigned to participate in the diaprogram or a waitlist control group. In this analysis, we focus on the qualitative data from the dia teachers and student students. We draw on writing and drawing samples, lesson plans, teacher reflections post instruction, and teacher reports in focus groups. We found that as teachers participated in dia, they reported providing increased emotional support to students and engaging in more student-centered practices. We also observed evidence in students’ descriptions of learning that their perceptions of themselves as learners shifted to embrace a more collaborative model.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:55Z (GMT).

Research highlights that quality professional development experiences can improve outcomes for youth workers, children and youth, and afterschool programs (Bowie & Bronte-Tinkew, 2006). The wide range of professional development initiatives include continuing education and credentialing programs, pre-service and in-service training, and distribution of resource like newsletters (Bowie & Bronte-Tinkew, 2006). Scholars and practitioners agree that the field must offer more professional development opportunities for youth workers.  While agreement exists across the field that youth workers must have access to quality professional, questions persist about how to best design consequential learning experiences that capture the complexities of the practice (Hall & Jurow, 2015).

Identifying and understanding these factors and controlling their effects are crucial for improving the validity and reliability of observation protocols. Here, we describe the application of many-faceted Rasch model (MFRM) to account for these effects in learning sciences research. We used data from 172 high school chemistry classroom videos to illustrate the utility of MFRM to model latent constructs related to raters. The analysis shows our raters can display high internal consistency with varying levels of bias despite intensive training. Such differences can significantly impact claims about teacher practice. We demonstrate how MFRM can incorporate these differences into a model that accounts for rater biases and other threats to validity. Additionally, the model allows for the incorporation of individual raters’ expertise into measures of teacher practice by accounting for identified variability without removing it.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:56Z (GMT).

This study examines four teachers’ practical conceptions of epistemic agency: the images of practice they associate with what “students participating with epistemic agency” looks like. To do this, we interviewed teachers before and after they enacted science units that they had designed with the goal of supporting students’ epistemic agency. We present four key constructs involved in teachers’ practical conceptions (coherence, flexibility, relevance, and student participation) and show how each teacher uniquely described these constructs in their teaching. This study is a starting point for characterizing the multidimensional work involved in supporting students as epistemic agents, including ongoing tensions that were raised. We discuss the implications of this work for supporting teacher learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:56Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Many teachers struggle with how to design classroom cultures that support PDE. This study proposes that PDE can be fostered through the design and effective implementation of cognitively demanding science tasks. In our analysis of the implementation of two contrasting lessons by the same teacher with the same group of students, we focused on how the teacher, students, and the task work together in a classroom activity system to support students’ PDE. Going beyond what PDE looks like, the study findings shed light on how it is fostered and the pedagogical factors that derive it.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:57Z (GMT).

These design principles are presented as based on strong evidence from large-scale, replicated and rigorous research studies, and as at the heart of consensus among PD scholars. In the present essay, we appraise the quality of the evidence on which this claim is based. We identify several major flaws in the research base on which such claims are based and conclude that, overall, the evidence is weak and claims about strong evidence-based findings is misleading.

However, given the ubiquity technology plays in our lives, it is imperative that all students have access to CT. Few studies have focused on how pre-service teachers (PSTs) learn about CT. Some researchers argue that CT integration into K-12 education belongs in teacher preparation programs and that teacher educators should develop courses aimed at supporting PSTs’ understanding of CT in the context of schools. This paper explores the ways in which PSTs begin to understand CT and how they work to integrate CT into their core subject areas.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:57Z (GMT).

By bringing Rancière’s (1991) notion of intellectual emancipation into the learning sciences scholarship on teaching, we paid attention to spatial- temporal structures that can free learners’ bodies and enrich mathematical discussion. Our findings show that, in regular routinized instruction, learning was streamlined and compressed to unidirectional acquirement. In contrast, designed embodied mathematics lessons offered a space of flexibility and spontaneity, which conceivably drove intellectual emancipation. Our research demonstrates how spatially and temporally expanded mathematics pedagogy can offer a complex system of iterative adaptation and decentralized learning. We discuss how integrating embodied mathematics learning and the perspective of intellectual emancipation can address equity issues in early mathematics education.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:58Z (GMT).

However, there is a lot more to learn on how teachers might integrate CT activities within their existing curricula. In this work, we describe a process of co-design with researchers and teachers to develop CT-infused science curricula. Specifically, we present a case study of one veteran physics teacher whose conception of CT during a professional development institute changed over time. We use this case study to explore how CT is perceived in physics instruction, a field that has a long history of computational learning opportunities. We also discuss how a co-design process led to the development of a lens through which to identify fruitful opportunities to integrate CT activities in physics curricula which we term computational transparency–purposefully revealing the inner workings of computational tools that students already use in the classroom.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:58Z (GMT).

In this paper, we use the context of this family program to study how families accessed and leverage resources to engage in creative computing, or designing, inventing, and expressing with computing. These resources and overlapping figured worlds of family, community, and computing allowed family members to explore new possible selves in the context of computing. This study has implications for how educators and designers provide access to resources for outreach programs that aim to engage non-dominant groups in computing.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:59Z (GMT).

Therefore, teacher educators would benefit from knowing how their pre-service teacher interns (aka student teachers) are framing their various classroom interactions. Unfortunately, detailed framing analysis typically relies on Interaction Analysis of video recordings. Teacher educators rarely have the access and time needed to collect and analyze such data. More commonly, teacher educators obtain pre-service teachers’ written reflections about their classroom interactions. We argue that a “lite” version of framing analysis allows teacher educators to infer at least a rough sense of how pre-service teachers are framing various classroom episodes, and this rough framing attribution is “instructionally actionable” in that it can inform the teacher educator’s next steps with pre-service teachers.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:29:59Z (GMT).

Meritocracy is often paired with a technocratic ideology, which distinguishes technical and “soft” skills and assigns more worth to the technical. Scholars have shown how technocracy and meritocracy contribute to marginalization within engineering education (Slaton, 2015; Foor et al., 2007; Secules et al., 2018). Our team has been iteratively redesigning a pedagogy seminar for engineering peer educators to disrupt such forces of marginalization. We study peer educators because they can do harm if these ideologies aren't challenged, and they have the potential to disrupt these ideologies. Using tools from discourse analysis and the ideology-in-pieces framework (Philip, 2011), we analyze how technocratic stances are reproduced or challenged in engineering peer educators’ talk. Such analyses can help others to recognize technocratic reasoning and see some of its negative consequences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:00Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Thirteen classroom teachers were interviewed to address what teachers identify as integral to support orchestration in collaborative inquiry learning. We present the design tensions between teacher and designer goals in working toward a collective vision of what it means to design intelligent cognitive assistants for classroom orchestration and discuss the implications for our design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:01Z (GMT).

While the research design aimed to document civic learning outcomes of the digitally-mediated curriculum, the data collection occurred after the external grants expired, leaving the teacher to conduct the unit without additional support. I describe the school as a liminal educational landscape, transitioning between contradictory trajectories of urban de-industrialization and market-based interventions, and characterized by a pervasive culture of precarity, negotiability, and vulnerability. I explore how these conditions interacted with technological innovation debris—digital devices and infrastructural remains of the intervention—to form shifting learning assemblages that occasionally cohered with the unit’s curricular virtualities, but often re-assembled into other technology-based activities relevant to the new cohort of students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:01Z (GMT).

This paper begins to challenge this assumption for pre-service teachers by documenting a paradigmatic case of one pre-service secondary math teacher’s sensemaking around the problem of student mathematical difficulty during field experiences. By examining how this teacher expressed causal reasoning about this problem during an interview, shifts in the teacher’s framing of this problem between productive and unproductive frames with respect to equity are apparent. These findings suggest that teacher education could support teachers to cue productive frames rather than replace unproductive frames.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:02Z (GMT).

We used grounded theory to analyze a set of naturalistic video recordings of undergraduate computing professors teaching recursion to their class.

Specifically, this study examines the types of course materials and resources in a secondary science methods course that support teachers as designers of equitable and authentic science learning experiences for students from racial, linguistic, and socioeconomic groups historically/currently marginalized in society, school, and science. Using pre-service teacher interviews and course artifacts, and instructor reflections and observations, this study seeks to better understand how pre-service teachers’ perspectives of science, goals for teaching science, and vision for their students shifted after engaging in an equity and justice-centered secondary science methods course. Findings from this study have implications for secondary science teacher education, policy, and practice. By exploring the learning and development of secondary science teachers through a critical, sociocultural, and learning sciences lens, findings demonstrate the types of experiences that have the potential to transform the teaching and learning of science in schools.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:03Z (GMT).

We thus take up the empirical study of planning the canoeing of rapids and the reasoning processes that underlie that practice, as we seek to contribute to theorizing planning as a form of human activity. In an ethnographic approach, we followed the routines of a team of canoers and collected video records (with helmet cameras) of the full arc of the activity, from the collective, discursive construction of the plan through the entire rapids run. We find that any given plan provided resources for canoeing action, without exhaustively describing it. Knowledgeable performance in the rapids thus emerged from the planning process and, crucially, the historically constituted practices of the team and individuals’ embodied knowledge and skills of canoeing.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:04Z (GMT).

The quintessential question these projects address is how teachers learn what they need to know and be able to do to create such contexts. Cross-cutting themes address contexts of professional learning, reflective practice, and iterative cycles of design, enactment, and re-design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:04Z (GMT).

Taking a socio-cultural approach, emotions may be viewed as a social construct, entangled with positioning and identification processes, relative to others as well as to ideal concepts of knowing, learning, and teaching. Emotions can be displayed in social interaction both verbally and non-verbally, explicitly and implicitly. This symposium presents four studies using a variety of discourse analysis methodologies to study socio-emotional dynamics in a range of professional development contexts: pre-service teachers in a science content and pedagogy course, science teachers within a blended-online program, math teachers in video-based debrief conversations, and elementary/middle school teachers in school-based team meetings. The findings of the four papers shed light into the critical role socio-emotional dynamics play in teacher professional learning, revealing different kinds of dynamics appearing in a broad range of topics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:05Z (GMT).

First, research often tests efficacy of professional learning interventions without illuminating how teachers learn within the intervention. Second, as a field, we have not reached consensus on how to document teacher learning, making it hard to share results in robust ways. For instance, researchers rarely view and discuss video from each other’s professional learning interventions, making it difficult to build shared ideas about concepts like “noticing student thinking” or about specific experiences that build teacher learning. To address these issues, this session will present professional learning video from four research projects focused on teachers’ learning to improve mathematics instruction. Video will be linked to a tentative conceptual framework of teacher learning that will be critiqued by the audience, discussant, and presenters, in order to expand it, identify gaps, and provide a shared framework for future research.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:05Z (GMT).

In this symposium, humanizing pedagogies are conceptualized and represented vis-à-vis video study as a vehicle for teachers’ re-imagining their classrooms and relationships with students (Buenrostro); multiplicities in teachers’ self-making through relationship-building with students (Chen); pedagogies related to humor (Shrodes) and desired futures (Uttamchandani) among LGBTQ+ youth who are makers and knowers in out-of-school spaces; and haunted present-pasts in a school community that is bridging institutional exclusion of students of color with disabilities (Yoon). These papers engage learning sciences theories and research methods such as teachers’ video analysis, design partnerships, consequential learning, and histories in person.

This symposium brings a sociopolitical lens to examine the relational aspects of teachers' learning. Attending to the ways power and privilege intersect with teachers’ relationships to STEM, the four papers highlight the role that race, class, and gender play in how teachers position themselves, are positioned, and are recognized by others in STEM. Across diverse in-service teacher education contexts, this collection contributes rich examples that characterize the powered and politicized nature of teachers’ relationships to STEM, examine how these relationships evolved over time, and reveal implications of these relationships for teaching. The symposium raises critical questions on how to support teachers in developing disciplinary relationships that foreground the politicized nature of teaching and learning STEM.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:06Z (GMT).

Moreover, we situate the work of teacher learning and teacher education as a viable pathway for exploring the ethical and political dimensions of learning and teaching within learning sciences. What opens up in the field of education when we take seriously the minds and personhood of teachers as learners who are simultaneously theorists, practitioners and political actors within complex ecologies? How might we leverage, at once, the generative tools of the learning sciences and the everyday, embodied and professional knowledge brought to bear by teachers? And finally, what tensions emerge within this work as we seek to expand conceptions of teaching and desettle narrow, dehistoricized definitions of learning (Bang et al, 2012; Philip et al, 2019)? Each paper proposed for this symposium responds to these question prompts with social design experiments (Gutiérrez & Vossoughi, 2010) that meld critical theories within the learning sciences with ideas about how to reimagine teacher learning and teacher professional development toward more just social futures. The symposium format is designed to engage the audience in substantive discussion of the ideas that are presented.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:06Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We take a syncretic approach, bringing together learning sciences research and perspectives from Black and Indigenous studies on the acts of creating, telling, and listening to stories. We consider the multiple roles of stories in research and design, the political/ethical nature of stories, and how storywork can re-organize power relations in ways that support individual and community life.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:07Z (GMT).

Such learning cannot be taken for granted in the typical school culture, however, as sharing problems exposes teachers’ work to scrutiny and criticism and may threaten the teachers’ face. This study examines under which circumstances face-work is involved in teachers’ discussion of problems of practice, based on interviews with leading teachers and observations of in-school meetings they led. Initial findings point to four major circumstances: (1) type of representation discussed (e.g., classroom video recordings, narrated case studies, or artifacts of student work); (2) group goal orientation (e.g., developing expertise versus demonstratingexpertise); (3) group composition and micropolitics in terms of teacher seniority and administrative roles; and (4) group maturation over time. The study advances our understanding of the socio-emotional processes involved in teacher collaborative learning, specifically the role of face-work in group discussion of problems of practice. On a practical level, understanding how and when face-work is involved in teacher discussions can help us better design and facilitate teacher collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:07Z (GMT).

Some challenges for PSTs include learning to “notice” students’ ideas as resources and to engage in principled pedagogical reasoning to inform future instruction. In our methods class, we wanted PSTs to rehearse noticing and exercising pedagogical reasoning as they served as the primary instructional leaders for an extended rehearsal of teaching we call “macroteaching”. We propose that macroteaching serves as an opportunity for PSTs to encounter unanticipated talk and actions, to make purposeful pedagogical decisions based on the emergent student discourse, and to move forward with instruction based on the decisions they made in-the-moment. In this paper, we describe how PSTs negotiated four learning opportunities during macroteaching, and describe our learning as teacher educators over three years of macroteaching enactment in methods courses.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:07Z (GMT).

This study reads poststructural theories of relationality alongside empirical data from a yearlong ethnographic study of two Algebra 1 teachers, integrating insights from theory with insights from practice to interrogate commonsensical understandings of student-teacher relationships. Drawing on Derrida’s interrogation of hospitality as a metaphor for inclusive and equitable classrooms, it offers a window into how teachers make sense of the complexity and ambiguity of relational work in a way that honors both student agency and their own authority. Findings can support secondary mathematics researchers and teachers in parsing and acting on the ethical commitments entailed in doing relational work within an unjust educational system.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:08Z (GMT).

We examine the relations between the school professional culture, the goal structures of its professional learning communities (PLCs), and teacher collaboration. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze data collected through surveys from 785 teachers from elementary schools participating in an Israeli national PLC program. The findings show that: (a) teachers perceived relational goals as the most important goals for their PLC; and (b) while school culture predicted mastery, performance, and relational goals structures, only mastery goals significantly predicted teacher collaboration. These findings suggest that PLCs aiming to promote teacher learning through collaboration should focus more on learning goals than on sheer social goals.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:08Z (GMT).

I present a case where a State system was well-aligned around text-based writing instruction. Teachers also had common understandings of the policies and aligned their goals for instruction. However, whether this was a successful system depends on the learning theory used to evaluate it. The coherent and tightly aligned system is a “success” within a behaviorist or cognitivist frame, but in tension with sociocultural theories: both in what was emphasized and lost and how alignment and convergence occurred. High-stakes tests were the lynchpin of alignment, which created institutional pressures for teachers to acculturate their writing instruction to test-based goals. As a result, educational discourse narrowed and converged, but at the expense of engaging with the sociopolitical, epistemic, ethical, and cultural aspects of literacy.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:09Z (GMT).

Drawing on the importance of learning mathematics through play in early childhood, this paper examines the affordances and constraints of implementing robot coding in a preschool setting across two initial screen-less coding sessions with the robot. Our findings suggest that children were challenged to connect the symbolic markers with the robot’s movement, requiring teacher scaffolding and facilitation. Nonetheless, we argue that coding experiences can support preschool mathematics learning outside of traditional pathways.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:09Z (GMT).

In this study, I trouble the ease with which the literature talks about agency in problem-posing and examine what is socially and emotionally at stake for students to do this work. Using micro-ethnographic case study approach, I investigate the interactions of a purposefully selected group of students in an eighth-grade mathematics classroom. I find that active listening and foregoing control over individual ideas to pursue collective imagining enabled students to negotiate the risks in a way that allowed them to productively engage in crafting a meaningful math problem. Using the findings, I conceptualize the notion of collective agency in problem posing and discuss why nurturing collective agency is a more productive and ethical goal for inquiry-based collaborative learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:10Z (GMT).

Through shared collaborative inquiry into teaching practice, teachers may build on their own knowledge and relate to formal concepts – concepts formulated by academics and policymakers for teachers. However, such studies have largely overlooked how teachers engage with formal concepts. By analyzing two contrasting discussions in one teacher meeting, which centered on the pedagogical concept of feedback, we explore how teachers manage uncertainty concerning such formal concepts. Specifically, we highlight the importance of paying more attention to epistemic moves in group discussions, as such moves represent a collective effort to integrate formal concepts with teachers' lived experiences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:10Z (GMT).

And, to what extent do interns reveal points in instruction where learning opportunities were widened or constrained? What is the nature of the challenges interns write about in relation to learning and enacting asset-based science instruction? Findings include: competing discourses between interns’ journal entries and reflection assignments presented both learning opportunities and constraints; curricular materials and degrees of autonomy presented challenges to enactment in the science classroom.

The literature mostly describes using this tool to facilitate development of teachers’ content understanding. In an investigation of a two-day professional development around a middle school storyline science curriculum, we found that the student hat not only supported teachers’ understanding of science ideas, but also their understanding of storyline curricular approaches and empathy with their students. This ability of the student hat to push on multiple goals suggests that it might be a valuable pedagogical tool for teacher educators to support teachers’ understanding of reform science curricular and expand their ideas about what counts as valuable reasoning in a science classroom.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:11Z (GMT).

The vignettes illustrate two main ways I unknowingly but explicitly exhibited White consciousness through my teaching discourse and practices, while marginalizing other valuable parts of students’ consciousness: 1) normalizing modern eurocentrism embedded in school science, and 2) framing capacity in English as evidence of excellence. While feeling regretful with the emerged findings, I muster up courage to report and discuss them as examples that can reoccur to those who are situated in the particularities of sociocultural and historical structures.

Also of interest to LS are the use, integration, and roles of technology in learning. We present initial findings of an empirical study examining the intersection of technology and teacher education. We view learning as a socio-material process of identity development in which the material and the social are entangled to mutually constitute the becoming of persons. We employ the concept of ‘coherence’ to analyze the ways in which pre-service teachers are positioned by, interact with, and experience technology both in their field placement sites and in their teacher education program by analyzing interview data of different constituencies related to teacher education. Our findings show that definitions of technology shape how constituencies see the role of technology in learning and where they believe technological expertise resides. Such views are consequential for the social and material organization of teacher learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:13Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Biology and physics pre-service teachers completed tests for their scientific reasoning skills, domain knowledge, and knowledge about the structure and diagnosis of scientific reasoning skills, and diagnosed a student’s scientific reasoning skills based on a video simulation. The results suggest that the influence of different aspects of professional knowledge may vary between different subjects, and that domain knowledge alone may have an effect on the accuracy of the diagnoses. So far, this could only be established for biology pre-service teachers. Since this study is still in progress, the results have to be considered preliminary.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:14Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We argue that common conceptualizations of language in the science education literature are insufficient and propose an alternative, Van Lier’s ecologicalmodel of language.  Using the practice of argumentation as an example, we show how an ecological approach would change how language is supported in the science classroom.  Such a change has the potential to disrupt traditional narratives of competence in science, particularly for students from non-dominant cultural and linguistic backgrounds.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:14Z (GMT).

We examine the changing epistemological frames (Hammer, Elby, Scherr, & Redish, 2005) through which students view their engineering work and describe how the PSTs talked and wrote about the relationships among engineering and their future practice as elementary and early childhood educators. Across the course, we see development from naïve notions of engineering’s importance as “hands-on” and engaging to more robust epistemologies about engineering as design and teaching engineering as creating productive contexts for students’ design processes. We focus on two students’ accounts of their own experiences of the engineering design process as centrally relevant to their pedagogical practice with elementary students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:14Z (GMT).

Supporting expansive sense-making, increased epistemic agency and authority, and more meaningful, consequential learning has proven elusive in elementary classrooms. Why is this the case? What can be done? This paper presents themes derived from analysis of multiple elementary science classroom video cases to hypothesize how sense-making shifts happen, albeit briefly, in a variety of classroom contexts and situations. Observing patterns in sense-making shifts enables us to confront how deep historical and cultural legacies of the grammar of schooling may inhibit shifts toward sense-making in science classrooms. These hypotheses raise implications for teacher education and for organizing schools to foster sense-making goals to support expansive and transformative science learning experiences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:16Z (GMT).

As interest in procedural flexibility as a learning outcome has increased, researchers have also begun to investigate teacher practices and features of learning environments that appear to promote flexibility. Drawing from video records of algebra instruction, we begin to articulate a more holistic theory of teaching for improved flexibility by describing instructional features that appear to be particularly instrumental in teaching for flexibility. We focus on three complementary and interrelated instructional practices - the use of (a) flexibility-eligible tasks, (b) structured instructional routines that leverage comparison of multiple strategies, and (c) discussion prompts that push students to consider affordances and constraints of the strategies that they have used.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:16Z (GMT).

While advantageous for supporting student learning through engaging in complex and interdisciplinary learning, integrating CS/CT into the elementary school curriculum can pose curricular and pedagogical challenges. For one, teachers themselves must understand the concepts and disciplinary practices associated with CS/CT and the other content areas being integrated, as well as develop a related pedagogical repertoire. This study addresses how two 3rd grade teachers made sense of the intersection of disciplinary practices and pedagogical practices to support student learning. We present preliminary findings from a Research-Practice Partnership that worked with elementary teachers to integrate aspects of CS/CT practice into existing content areas. We identified two main disciplinary activities that drove their curriculum design and pedagogical practices: (1) the importance of productive frustration and failure; and (2) the importance of precision.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:16Z (GMT).

It is often one of the central features of pre-service and in-service teacher development, and considered the everyday practice of teaching. While reflection is considered a good rule of thumb for teacher learning, there have been few empirical studies that seek to connect the process of reflection to changes in teachers’ knowledge, beliefs, and practices. We report on preliminary findings of a systematic review of the literature on teachers’ video reflection. We use these findings to map the design space for learning through reflection and learning technologies that can support this process.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:17Z (GMT).

As maker education wrangles the logics of making as market-oriented career preparation and desire-based creativity, we explore how artist mentors (n=12) work with youth in a large metropolitan PLM. Drawing on interviews and observations, we find artist mentors reconciling the economic and creative logics of making through pedagogical moves that exalt teen voice, and conjure imagined futures in-the-now (prolepsis). We argue these outcomes are not happenstance: Harmonizing the economic and creative impulses of making mirrors the professional histories of artist mentors themselves and PLMs, as public institutions of influence. We conclude by discussing the future of maker pedagogies and PLMs as consequential sites of teaching and learning, within the broader sociopolitical project of maker education.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:17Z (GMT).

I introduce the concept of casual emotion work to describe how seemingly non-pedagogical practices during community social events can support the uptake of ways of feeling that are understood as strategically valuable for broader social transformation. The study has implications for how learning scientists understand emotion as a dimension of relationality with consequences for both learning and politics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:18Z (GMT).

We use videotape analysis to characterize their scaffolding choices and draw on classroom observation notes to enrich the descriptions. We find that during their introductory whole-class discussion of the investigation, one teacher focused on helping students consider how to construct the physical set-ups to get the data they wanted, while the other teacher focused on having students identify all the variables that could come into play. The teachers differed on what to scaffold and when, including which aspects of set-up design to specify versus which to elicit from their students. Taken together, the scaffolding strategies these teachers used during whole-class guided discussion offer several new ideas for preparing students to engage productively with noisy data.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:18Z (GMT).

Our goals are to design responsive teacher professional development, create opportunities that amplify parent voices and family involvement, and support student identity.  In our work, teachers have an innovative method of instruction and a new tool for cultivating home-school partnerships centered on academics. Students have a method of engaging in scientific practices that are relevant to their experiences, and parents have a new avenue for contributing to their child’s science learning.  Our overall research goal is to create connected learning experiences for teachers, students, and families.  We present descriptive findings that show how our work is helping teachers to integrate science and culture.  We also present ways that students and parents are being invited to share their personal and cultural identities in science classes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:19Z (GMT).

Influenced by work from Ilana Horn (2007), we set out to determine if FOLCs recreate or challenge dominant ideologies towards students as fast, slow, or lazy. After analyzing transcripts from recordings of FOLC meetings, we found that while these discussions at times recreate problematic student framings, there are also explicit challenges to this ideology (e.g. away from dominant problematic framings toward a focus on student learning). We find that these contestations are taken up more in later meetings though there isn’t necessarily a clear convergence on these alternative ideologies. In further research, we hope to determine if convergence toward alternative ideologies and a focus on student learning occurs more frequently over time within the FOLC.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:19Z (GMT).

Posthumanism is about rethinking the relations between the human and nonhuman by challenging the anthropocentric thinking. Education scholars tend to regard posthumanism as critical social theories rather than theoretical frameworks for practice. The emergence of posthuman discourses in the field of education indicates a need for a pedagogy that represents the transformation. However, there is a lack of research on how posthuman pedagogy is defined, described, and practiced. This study presents findings from a conceptual analysis, which elucidates four characteristics of the idea of posthuman pedagogy. Based on these characteristics, we argue that posthuman pedagogy informs the rethinking of the relationships embodied in pedagogy and the reimagination of the dynamic practice of learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:20Z (GMT).

In the scenario, a child (fifth grade) approaches the teacher to complain about how they are not getting called on to show their work at the board. The scenario was implemented as an in-class small group activity with undergraduates enrolled in an elementary licensure program. The main findings reveal four typical response components—apologize, explain, solve, and appreciate. Our results are presented in two sections. First, descriptive statistics are used to analyze the occurrence and co-occurrence of codes by response. Second, using qualitative analysis, we describe some of the different sub-codes (e.g., direct apology vs. non-apology) that, in turn, reflect different interpersonal relationships.

In India too, there is a push in creating maker spaces in schools. However, there is a limited realisation of the potential possibly due to the limited understanding of this in the teachers. Here, we attempt to engage with the teachers in a meaningful way. This paper captures the initial understanding of making in a cohort of 21 science and 19 mathematics teachers of government schools in India. Further, it highlights the nuances in the understanding of the making culture (developing a framework) and its broader implications after reflecting on the video prompt and collective discussion with the teachers. Using this evidence of teachers eliciting subtleties of learning and making culture, we argue for a greater possibility of and a need for meaningful teacher-researcher engagement for reimagining learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:23Z (GMT).

However, even in research showing the importance of sociocultural factors, quantitative assessment of Computer Science learning has been predominantly cognitive. This study presents an example of how quantitative assessments of learning, based on cognitive and sociocultural framings of learning, can be put into dialogue by developing measures of learning on internal individual terms and understood as participation in a community of practice. We develop two participation-based constructs assessed using methods from learning analytics, and show that each is significantly associated with better performance on a cognitively-based summative assessment of computer science content. These associations are mediated by the content of students' programs. Beyond serving as contextual factors for cognitive assessments, we propose treating these constructs as primary evidence of learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:32Z (GMT).

The study is situated in the context of a programme-level culmination task enacted as a public, performance-based assessment in which small groups of pre-service teachers devise and perform interactive poster presentations to peers, teachers and community stakeholders. Specifically, the study focuses on the talk and actions of pre-service teachers (n=6) and their expert instructors (n=5) across 12 video recordings (in-class rehearsals and final presentations) and 6 audio recorded video-stimulated recall interviews with the pre-service teachers (post-assessment). Analysis-in-progress builds on Pellegrino’s (2018) concept of ‘evidentiary reasoning’ to trace situated expert and peer feedback and student self-reflections within and across the in-class rehearsals and the final capstone performances. Findings are illuminating the consequential impact of these dialogues on pre-service teacher learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:42Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

When teachers learn, they listen to people talk about teaching, or talk about teaching themselves, but they very rarely do the work of teaching. Games and simulations offer a promising framework to advance practice-based professional training for complex skills such as teaching. In this work, we built a role-playing simulation ELK to help teachers develop effective questioning strategies to elicit learner prior knowledge. We evaluate ELK with 76 pre-service teachers in two modes, “Chat” and “Code”. We find that in both modes ELK raises teachers’ awareness about student misconceptions and the importance of student thinking, and teachers demonstrate a modest increase in effective questioning strategies after three rounds of playing.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:43Z (GMT).

Drawing on literature of equity and school reform, we attended to infrastructure, routines, constancy in vision, and collective efficacy as inputs to these systems. We used case study analytic methods to understand each state context before conducting qualitative comparative analysis to analyze the configurations of inputs that supported the most progress toward equity. The analysis revealed that progress toward equity in state systems was consistent with the configurations of constancy with routines, constancy with infrastructure, or collective efficacy on its own. It is hopeful that collective efficacy was a sole input for two states with progress toward equity and coherence, yet progress should be systemic, not placed on individuals. We discuss tensions in understanding equity at scale through qualitative comparative methodology and case studies as well as practical ramifications for educational leaders.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:49Z (GMT).

We present an analysis of three cases, each showcasing different patterns of interaction. In one case, a preverbal child is centered in their interaction through the actions and utterances of her parents. In another case, a father provides translation support such that his daughter can make her desired code changes a reality. Finally, we present a case in which the father’s actions and words strongly guide the interaction, decentering the goals of the child. Our study has implications for future research regarding family interactions in museums, as well as the design of informal learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:49Z (GMT).

At a classroom level of analysis, we used instructional logs and a multilevel latent variable model to explore variation in the science practices that teachers enacted and to quantify the relationship between the enactment of science practices and classroom demographics. We used an electronic exit ticket and two multilevel logistic regression models to estimate differences in students’ contributions to knowledge-building activities in the classroom controlling for student-level demographics.

This paper reports on a DBIR project in Hong Kong supporting teachers to use self-directed learning approach in STEM education. In crafting conditions for the project implementation, one of the design principles is building multilevel architecture for learning to strengthen school leaders and teachers’ capacity to be self-organized in the long term. In-depth case studies on two schools participating in the project shows feedback loops play a key role in the self-organized learning of teachers and school principals. Teachers as brokers could facilitate the spread of innovative practice.

In this study we followed two STE(A)M curricular innovations at different stages of development, as they made attempts to scale across two years through collaborations with practitioners. Our comparative case study explores how instances of dialogical learning facilitated boundary crossing (Akkerman and Bakker, 2011), which played a key role in shaping scaling efforts and usability. We illustrate how scale can be conceptualized and studied as a learning problem, using the lens of boundary crossing. This work addresses the need for longitudinal studies of researcher and practitioner collaborations, as well as the need for research that goes beyond the initial stages of an innovation’s implementation, contributing to our understanding of what makes a successful and sustainable scaling effort.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:52Z (GMT).

This can create a tension because the theory and mechanisms generated from small scale studies can be difficult to implement and study at larger scales.

This paper presents a conceptual framework for research on spread and scale in a digital age that accounts for the interactions among environments, organizations, individuals, and educational innovations. Most existing scholarship on scale-up comes from the pre-digital age. Digital technologies often reimagine how learning occurs, requiring new capacities for adults who use them with children and new pathways for scale-up. Drawing on interviews, case studies, and a comprehensive literature review on scale in education and other fields, the framework provides guidance for designers who seek to spread and scale digital learning innovations and for researchers who seek to study these processes.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:53Z (GMT).

The conditions for learning depend on the development of boundary spanners, practices, and objects that facilitate joint work. Engaging productively at the boundaries of is moderated by the prior conditions of educational organizations and their research partners. Where mutual learning occurs at the boundaries, we are more likely to see changes in collective knowledge, policies, and routines for participating organizations.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:53Z (GMT).

We focus on engagement with tensions that emerge in this process and how members’ engagement with a central tension—language acquisition versus multilingualism—unfold to shape the network’s aim. Our analysis revealed that the evolving ways members engaged tensions over time shaped the network’s aim and theory of improvement in ways that came to also shape the NIC’s institutional logic.

First, we explore the range of ways the learning sciences has positioned settings theoretically and analytically, and some conceptual consequences of these choices. We then describe a cross-setting approach that de-centers schools as a primary analytical site for   learning   disciplinary content, and instead treats them as part of a larger ecology in youths’ lives. We share analyses of two episodes from one youth’s learning pathway to illustrate how a cross-setting analysis can expand a single-sited conceptualization of his   resources for learning, in this case to include relational practices. This paper advances current scholarship on learning across settings by examining closely and empirically how cross-setting approaches might productively trouble and re-configure how we conceptualize nondominant youths' lives in the learning sciences.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:55Z (GMT).

Five research groups will present their current work on MDA, each with a unique focus on different data sources and different approaches to the analysis and synthesis of multimodal data sets. A few themes emerge from these studies: i) the studies seek to examine collaborative behaviors as a process in ordinary settings, both formal and informal; ii) with MDA being in its early stage, manual and computational approaches are taken complementarily, also using  human annotation as the ground truth for the computational approach; and iii) several different discipline-specific research and development lines contribute integrally to generating authentic measures of collaborative interactions in situ, making this line of research transdisciplinary.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:56Z (GMT).

The case is the OpenSciEd Project, which is an initiative to create and disseminate a 3-year, middle school science program. The OpenSciEd project has the explicit goal of meeting three competing goals in order to have impact at scale: implementing findings from research (research-based), meeting the practical constraints of American public school classrooms (practicality), and creating products that will be widely adopted in the market place (marketability). In this symposium, we will discuss how these three competing goals have influenced the organization of the project, the design of instructional materials, the design of professional learning experiences for teachers, and the collection and analysis of data in field trials.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:56Z (GMT).

The goal of this study is thus to investigate enabling conditions and limiting factors of scale and specifically how these factors relate to each other by applying a data-driven approach. That is, conducting interviews with experts in the field of scaling-up adaptive educational technologies. By conducting expert interviews, we had access to their accumulated expertise about scaling factors and the interplay between these factors. For our analysis, we applied Epistemic Network Analysis. The analysis positioned collaboration between stakeholders at the core of the network and revealed the strongest connection between collaboration and teacher characteristics such as teacher concerns, competencies and professional development.

This approach maximizes productive disciplinary engagement via public discussion of student “wikifolios” in threaded comments. Formative self-assessments and automated quizzes minimize grading and private instructor interaction with students while supporting and documenting achievement. This approach can be implemented in any modern learning management system or using Google tools. It was successfully used to scale up an online course for hundreds of open learners. But an extended partnership to scale out at a fully online high school revealed that educators who were unfamiliar and/or uncomfortable with sociocultural theory found the approach difficult to implement. In response, five design principles have been reframed as fourteen specific steps that do not require familiarity with sociocultural theory.

In implementing a given program, especially one designed to be highly adaptive, facilitators will undoubtedly modify the program. Few studies, however, have examined such adaptations.  In this study, we examined the adaptations made by mathematics teacher leaders to a highly-adaptive program of professional development. We considered how teacher leaders modified, omitted, and created activities, focusing questions, and other aspects of the program. We found that facilitators made modifications to address local priorities, yet also omitted core program activities as the project progressed. Our study illustrates a tension encountered by developers of adaptive PD programs between wanting a program to be adaptable enough that facilitators will continue to implement it as their priorities shift and keep core aspects of the program intact.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:59Z (GMT).

NICs are an increasingly popular model of a research-practice partnership that relies on practitioner insight to improve the design of solutions. Therefore understanding how NIC activities generate the kinds of insight needed for network-level learning is critical to understanding the implementation of the model. Drawing on qualitative data collected during the initiation of a NIC, I show how a video club activity provided a way for educators to generate, select, and integrate improvement ideas into a subsequent design task. The analysis provides insight into how the features and sequence of activities can be organized to support problem-solving in a NIC.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:30:59Z (GMT).

To do so as a field necessitates the development of methodologies and infrastructure aimed at aggregating knowledge across partnerships. We aim to initiate conversation among learning scientists about the potential to systematically aggregate insights about how characteristics and dynamics of systems of practice interact with implementation efforts.

However, Becker’s analysis was based on a comparison of ethnographic studies of on-the-job learning with an ideal typical representation of school. This paper revisits the issue of whether and how schools may be a lousy place to learn by listening to and interpreting the perspectives of students themselves. We draw on a sample of 300 interviews with students conducted in the context of researching what and how students learned in a program called FUSE Studios, which we have previously conceptualized as “an alternative infrastructure for learning in schools”. We asked students whether and how FUSE was different from their other classes, and their responses provided us with a unique window into what students think of school as a learning environment. Herein, we share their perspectives and draw implications for future learning sciences work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:05Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This study aims to better understand the collaborative partnership during actual teaching and learning processes. Using content analysis, we examined the instructor-student collaborative partnership  from participation moves perspective in an online course. Results show that the instructor and students keep mutual interactions to construct knowledge; they maintain communications to design and implement online discussions; and they take joint actions to form a social, supportive learning environment. More importantly, a synergistic collaborative partnership was initially developed by the instructor and students. Based on the results, we provided implications to advance practices of the instructor-student collaborative partnership in online learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:10Z (GMT).

But this emphasis creates both social and epistemic risks for students: the process of building knowledge requires continually identifying and wrestling with uncertainty, and building knowledge collectively requires making that uncertainty public. In this study, I investigate how a classroom community shifted to become a place where students regularly participated in risky science knowledge-building. I theorize that this shift occurred through a process of trust-building, and utilize this case to further elucidate the phenomenon of trust-building in the context of science learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:10Z (GMT).

In this study, I examine how one group of 9th grade students enacted turn-taking instructions during a small-group Algebra task. Patterns of participation evolved over time, from individual turn-taking to “collaborative-play” as the need to consult with peers to address challenges arose organically. Analysis reveals turn-taking and collaborative-play supported different types of productive student participation. Turn-taking supported individual contributions by slowing down task completion and by distributing access to the conversational floor across students. Collaborative-play supported joint contributions by shifting responsibility for issue resolution from an individual to the group. Findings suggest the two modes of participation supported complementary, and most likely interdependent, types of productive participation during small-group work.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:11Z (GMT).

Students used information about their affiliated institution (e.g., admission rates, admission stances, and institutional mission statements) and details from a “private” biography (e.g., life story, biases) to inform decisions about who to admit. We analyzed survey responses (n=60) and semi-structured interviews (n=7) of students who participated in the simulation. We report on students’ perceptions of role-playing and focus on how they negotiated internal conflicts that arose when their personal viewpoints did not align with those of the roles they embodied.

Words in students’ reflections were clustered based on similarity of use (represented in a 50-dimensional word-embedding model); these concepts were characterized at three points in time by constructing co-occurrence networks of constituent words and inspecting representative sentences. Analysis of 4,069 reflection statements from 378 students over four years revealed twelve relevant concepts. Over time, students’ vision of Becoming a Professional showed increased emphasis on ethical practices, shifting focus from self-as-dentist to Providing the Best Patient Care. In addition to gaining Confidence through Progress to be a part of the Field of Dentistry, students also personalized their view of the profession, coming to Know Oneself as a Dentist and, at times, connecting this to their Life Vision. Implications for the theory, study and support of professional identity development are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:12Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, existing learning from failure models do not always take collaborative process, a key aspect of design, into account. The ultimate goal is to design tools to better support young design teams’ collaborative learning from design failure process in an after-school design club with students in grades 4-6. In this article, we examine how teams use discourse to learn from design failure collaboratively by analyzing video data and group artifacts. Our findings suggest that the specific communication process can support or hinder the learning from failure in design contexts and that there’s a need to support team’s regulation process so they can benefit from their design failure.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:12Z (GMT).

In classrooms children largely do math for math’s sake. In other settings, when children engage in mathematical thinking, they often do so in service of purposeful actions situated in ongoing activities. This study rests on the premise that immersive video games can be designed to provide a context for purposeful mathematical thinking. This paper examines middle-school students’ mathematical thinking in a video game designed to support applications of proportional reasoning. Data sources include screen-records of game play from two 6th-grade classrooms. Data analysis aims to identify and characterize the kinds of mathematical thinking students engaged in during game play. Findings suggest that in the same video game students’ mathematical thinking varied, both within and between students, reflecting previously observed distinctions between street and school mathematics.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:13Z (GMT).

This paper presents a cross-section of that analysis, focusingon the limitations of existing frameworks in capturing important nuances in researchers’ beliefs.The findings reveal a variety of ways learning scientists resist particular frameworks.

Public longitudinal data was downloaded from 78 Kerbal Space Program players, which informed the selection of two comparative case studies selected to illustrate ways in which identity exploration may manifest. To inform the case studies, lines of player data were coded as representative of identity exploration as defined by Projective Reflection. Findings align with existing research to illustrate how individuals may be enculturated into or pushed out of affinity spaces based on their patterns of identity exploration over time.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:14Z (GMT).

Peer talk could manifest the trajectory of group thinking. Existing studies intensively explored potential talk moves that could facilitate effective collaboration. Yet, very few studies explored in-depth move-taking sequences that indicated sustained group thinking trajectory. To help address this gap, the present study conceptualized thinking sustainability to characterize the co-constructiveness of individuals’ thinking and quantified it as an index on the interdependence of productive talk moves taken by individuals. The study further demonstrated how thinking sustainability dynamically developed in collaborative mathematical problem solving by 30 four-person groups in primary schools. Results showed that each group engaged in productive talk for around 3.85 consecutive turns. There was no significant correlation between thinking sustainability and group outcomes. Thinking sustainability was sensitive to early exchanges in peer talk and reached a stable level quite soon. This demonstrated it as another possible fixed-point attractor underlying random-looking peer interaction systems.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:15Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, prior research suggests that visual representations alone are not necessarily effective across a broad range of students. To address this problem, we created a novel, scaffolded form of diagrammatic self-explanation in which students explain their problem-solving steps in the form of diagrams. We used contrasting cases to support students’ sense-making between algebraic equations and diagrams in the self-explanation activity. We conducted a classroom experiment with 41 students in grades 5 and 6 to test the effectiveness of this strategy when embedded in an Intelligent Tutoring System for algebra. We found that scaffolded diagrammatic self-explanation enhanced conceptual knowledge for students who did not have prior knowledge of formal equation-solving strategies. The study is the first experimental study showing that visual representations can enhance conceptual knowledge in early algebra.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:16Z (GMT).

Not only do learners need to have collaboration skills and knowledge about beneficial interaction processes, but they also need to monitor socio-cognitive conditions to be able to regulate their own as well as their learning partners’ behaviour. External collaboration scripts are an explicit way to support collaborating learners and compensate for insufficient cognitive schemata, so called internal collaboration scripts. Group awareness tools guide learning activities implicitly and compensate for a lack of awareness of relevant socio-cognitive conditions while explicitly relying on the learners’ self-regulatory skills. A combination of the different approaches has been investigated scarcely so far, though they have a promising potential for mutual synergies. Thus, in this symposium, researchers from scripting-, group awareness-, and regulation-research discuss how their approaches are connected and how external collaboration scripts or group awareness tools can be combined to support collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:17Z (GMT).

How does attending to gender and sexuality expand how we understand learning? And how can the field be mobilized to design affirming learning environments for LGBTQ+-identifying people? Across the papers, we explore gender and sexuality’s relevance for learning in contexts as wide-ranging as video channels on YouTube, an LGBTQ+ youth social group, Twitter networks of drag queen activists, and a public computing participatory simulation. Taken together, these papers will deepen the field’s attention to gender and sexuality in learning sciences theories, methods, and designs.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:17Z (GMT).

The abundance of digital technologies and rapid changes in knowledge domains generate new epistemic and learning practices, drawing on heterogeneous sets of resources, actors, and forms of knowledge. Consequently, learners must navigate complex and unstructured landscapes to gather resources and structure activities. Little is known about these processes and how they can be studied and enhanced. This symposium argues for the necessity of a paradigmatic shift towards an ‘ecological understanding’ of learning, which takes into account the enactment of the learning ‘act’, the knowledge forms, contexts, relationships, digital technologies and infrastructures that shape learning practices in unbound landscapes. The four contributions in this symposium use empirical illustrations to build an argument leading towards a new learning research and design agenda. These contributions are complementary as they pinpoint practices students, teachers and institutions engage with in this unbounded landscape.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:18Z (GMT).

In this symposium, we present different theoretical and disciplinary perspectives on understanding how learners engage in debugging applications on and off screen, examine learners’ mindsets about debugging from middle school to college students and teachers, and present pedagogical approaches that promote strategies for debugging problems, even having learners themselves design problems for others. We contend that learning to identify and fix problems—debug, troubleshoot, or get unstuck—in completing projects provides a productive space in which to explore multiple theoretical perspectives that can contribute to our understanding of learning and teaching critical strategies for dealing with challenges in learning activities and environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:18Z (GMT).

Cognitive interactions mediate knowledge sharing, construction, and creation, while social-emotional interactions shape student perception of community climate and influence their emotional expressions, which, in turn, have a significant impact on their cognitive interactions. Although research has consistently found that social presence and student-student interaction has a positive influence on students' learning through emotional engagement, subject-based teaching remained largely more of cognitive activities. Teachers tend to treat lessons that heightened social-emotional aspects separate from subject-based lessons. This symposium brings together an international group of scholars to present recent studies on emotion and cognition in collaborative learning environments. Methods, such as self-report, video observation, affective state detection using FACET, and machine learning models, were adopted to investigate students' emotions. The results collectively suggest that these methods indeed served to uncover students' emotions; emotions such as joy/enjoyment/happiness, confidence, and surprise were associated with students' knowledge building progress; and that students' online interactions had a high impact on the emotional and linguistic tone of learners. The symposium aims to discuss the theoretical, practical and policy implications of these studies on collaborative learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:19Z (GMT).

This session explores how several scholars have applied and pushed for revisions of existing theories as the Learning Sciences field seeks to better understand young children’s sensemaking. Each paper takes up two central questions: (1) How is existing LS theory drawn upon in each study? (2) How is new theory built or existing LS theory modified in each study? The goal of attending to these questions is that participants in this symposium might better understand the ways that existing theory does and does not work when studying young children.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:20Z (GMT).

The first paper embraces a sociological concept of academic hospitality to look at how different modes of interdisciplinarity are adopted in university courses. The second paper adopts an activity-centered framework to investigate the development of students’ competence during interdisciplinary learning. The third paper takes a linguistic perspective and examines connectedness as a measure of interdisciplinarity in students’ produced artifacts. The last paper adopts a multimodal blending lens to look at how students during interdisciplinary innovation meetings integrate their ideas and construct shared knowledge artefacts. The contributions brought together provide a broad conceptual and methodological ‘toolkit’ for studying interdisciplinary learning from different analytical perspectives and at different levels of granularity.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:20Z (GMT).

Normative scripts around the use of data position them as a privileged epistemic form conferring authority through objectivity that can serve as a lever for effecting change. However, humans and materials shape how data are created and used which can reinscribe existing power relations in society at large (Van Wart, Lanouette & Parikh, 2020). Thus, research is needed on how learners can be supported to engage in critical data literacies through sociocultural perspectives. As a field intimately concerned with data-based reasoning, social justice, and design, the learning sciences is well-positioned to contribute to such an effort. This symposium brings together scholars to present theoretical frameworks and empirical studies on the design of learning spaces for critical data literacies. This collection supports a larger discussion around existing tensions, additional design considerations, and new methodologies.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:21Z (GMT).

This study conceptualizes ‘brokering pre-professional learning opportunities’ as a practice that goes beyond facilitating access across settings to include concerns about when, exactly, an opportunity is ‘safe enough’ when supporting connections for minoritized youth populations. Utilizing a design-based research approach, we report results of an organizational ‘vetting’ routine used to assess whether companies being considered for work-placement sites were appropriate for minoritized youth of color. Our findings confirm that characteristics of staff diversity and equity orientation of work-placement organizations can support or hinder positive learning outcomes. However, we also found that both strengths and limitations in terms of diversity and equity, in concert with other supportive factors, can be productive resources within the context of future goal setting for youth of color. We close with implications for those interested in promoting equity-oriented cross-setting learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:23Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Collectively, the papers ask: What becomes visible, analytically, when we take learning to be politically and ethically laden? What do we miss when we don’t attend to these dimensions of learning? What does foregrounding ethics mean for how we design and study human learning and meaning-making? Each paper addresses these questions by providing key empirical examples drawn from ethnographic research on the activity, relationality and learning of 1) researchers; 2) teachers; and 3) students. Our analysis is aimed at constructing lenses that challenge the politics of neutrality in research on learning, and that deepen our analytic perception by helping us attune to intellectual and relational dimensions of learning that we may not otherwise see.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:23Z (GMT).

However, over socio-historic time we have created institutions that have shifted, disrupted, and transformed not only what is, or is not learned in intergenerational contexts but also how learning itself unfolds. This is particularly true in industrialized nation states in which mass schooling has become a central facet of childhood (e.g. Rogoff, 2003, Cole,  1998). Importantly, the disruption and transformation of intergenerational learning has not been happenstance or desired for all communities. Indeed, disrupting and preventing intergenerational learning (e.g. through family break up and child extraction) has been a key tool of domination across time. This symposium works to understand both the disruptions and reimaginings of the engagement of families and intergenerational learning dynamics with insights into the design of more effective learning environments that contribute to human thriving.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:24Z (GMT).

Moreover, we surface the expansive nature of sports as a context that can touch on the cognitive, social, cultural and political elements of one’s identities and lived experiences. In summary, we present and discuss examples from on-going learning sciences research that highlights the innovative ways that researchers and learners are collaborating to realize new opportunities at the intersection of sports and technology.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:26Z (GMT).

Struggles to achieve meaningful social change through these initiatives are often studied as a public policy or leadership crises, yet could and should be addressed anew as a matter of learning that is mediated by practitioners’ socio-political identities in organizational contexts. This symposium takes up this challenge, exploring how organizational settings mediate practitioner learning and activity to determine the relationship between macro-level equity discourses and micro-level socio-political identity. We build on theoretical and empirical work across organizational learning, educational equity, and identity. Across these papers we explore the relationship between identity and equity work in four distinct organizational contexts: 1) a faculty learning community within a research university, 2) two education grantmaking organizations, 3) science museums, and 4) an out-of-school time STEM education provider.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:26Z (GMT).

In particular, we question colonial assumptions about time and propose new conceptions of temporality that allow us to expand what we see as learning, and how we see it unfold. What are the temporalities that emerge from and are imposed on communities engaged in learning? We take up a temporality lens that (1) unpacks elements of practice and identity that are obscured by placing all participants and communities in a shared framework of settler time, and (2) draws out the subjective temporalities of the event that are produced by participants in interaction. The three papers, from a study of an afterschool documentary filmmaking program, consider “slow” temporalities of learning in this setting as well as how “slowing down” research practices decolonize assumptions of settler time in marginalized spaces.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:27Z (GMT).

This means understanding that learning unfolds through multiple pathways that occur in relation to expansive and shifting social and contextual conditions, to which humans are constantly adapting. Emerging across relevant fields is an understanding that human learning and development unfolds within complex systems. These include interactions among physiological processes and people’s participation in cultural practices within and across time (phylogenetic time, cultural historical time, ontogenetic time, and microgenetic time) and across spaces. Here, we bring together interdisciplinary perspectives and research methods to elaborate an expansive vision of learning that ignites further inquiry into the cultural foundations of learning—the topic of a new Routledge Handbook. The symposium builds on the volume by engaging participants in roundtable discussions with authors from each of the major sections of the Handbook. Key to this inquiry are fundamental stances about what constitutes and is privileged as human ways of knowing, being, and doing. Without attention to how the question, “what is learning?,” gets understood and changes over time comes the risk of falling into reductionist and problematic views of learning, that are unfounded empirically and further reproduce social inequities,  At a time when key concerns about how educational spaces, systems, and teaching should be designed, funded, and assessed, this foundational work on learning is especially critical.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:28Z (GMT).

Epistemic cognition research may play a key role in understanding and developing such capacities. Recent shifts in epistemic cognition that draw on social epistemology are to be welcomed, however, there is further potential here in drawing on a recent ethical turn in epistemology to make explicit the ethical assumptions underpinning the area of epistemic cognition. That is, that epistemic cognition has ethical dimensions, including that we (1) care about consequential issues, epistemic issues that have stakes, (2) have epistemic obligations, and (3) should attend to concerns of epistemic injustice. I argue for scoping epistemic cognition to recognize these ethical turns, reflecting that the significance of bringing these concerns – already present in much work – into focus for further inquiry.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:29Z (GMT).

Studies have shown that (1) learners would more successfully engage in idea improvement when they were aware of idea promisingness, and (2) they would be more successful when they had appropriate epistemic frames of idea promisingness. This study examined group differences in idea improvement processes. Seventy first-year university students (18 groups) participated in Project-based Learning with Knowledge Forum as their reflection tool. Six types of idea improvement processes were identified through socio-semantic network analyses of vocabulary in participants’ progress reports and a clustering analysis based on the temporal changes in degree centralities. Further comparative analysis with audio-recordings as additional data revealed that successful groups not only started with good judgments of idea promisingness but also continuously considered multiple ideas and jointly constructed coherent explanations based on evidence they searched.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:30Z (GMT).

Each student was given a critical thinking test at the beginning of the course, and the students were divided into high and low achievement groups based on the results. An epistemic network analysis is adopted to analyze their critical thinking behaviors in the online discussion. The results show that the epistemic network graphs of the two groups of students were significantly different, and varied at different stages of the online inquiry. Findings of this study have significant implications on designing activities for engaging college students in critical thinking and productive knowledge building discourse.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:31Z (GMT).

We explore how these efforts, grounded in dynamic theories of identity, encountered challenges in different nationalist contexts, Catalonia in Spain and the United States, when seeking to counteract deficit views of others and re-center curriculum in community priorities. We call for sustained attention to global nationalism as a context that can potentially undermine efforts to link curriculum and identity and for continued attention to the dynamic, fluid character of identity when seeking to connect curriculum and identity.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:31Z (GMT).

One harm that may come from epistemic injustice is that people are denied their ability to become full epistemic agents either on their own or as part of a greater knowledge production process. In this paper, we address the consequences of epistemic injustices for knowledge production processes. We argue that when pertinent experiences, knowledge, or expertise that would be provided by the harmed person is left out of a knowledge production process, the community is denied that knowledge, as well as the ability to leverage that knowledge into an alternative or deeper understanding of the situation at hand. Therefore, epistemic injustices are not only unethical. Epistemic injustices obstruct reliable epistemic practices. We discuss implications of issues of epistemic injustice for scholarship on epistemic cognition.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In this study, we combine content analysis with computational linguistics to explore the collaboration patterns of 22 first-year students during face-to-face group design (n = 7,514 conversational turns) in a project-based engineering course. We find that students who reported low peer support generally produced discourse that provides new information, but less cohesion, compared to students with perceived median and high support networks. Overall, students with low perceived networks also engaged in group planning, evaluation, and shared regulation less frequently compared to the other two groups. Findings have implications for adjusting group arrangement in design activities. The study also illustrates the potential of incorporating computational approaches to detecting discourse.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:33Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

We apply discourse analysis and find that student displayed enriched discourse in vocabulary and practices, but not CS concepts, in response to explicit prompts. Frequencies of vocabulary use and connection to programming narratives in reflections were strongly correlated with programming artifact scores (overall score; sub-scores in user interactivity, mechanics, and computer science constructs).

Indeed, these educator ideologies play a significant role in the implementation of classroom discourse practices, while learner ideologies contribute to the ways in which students take up those practices. In this paper, we examine learner and educator ideologies surrounding the role of SCT in learning and engaging in the middle-grades classroom. Drawing on teacher interviews and student focus groups, the present study offers a framework for examining the ways in which educator and learner ideologies surrounding student-centered talk align or misalign. Findings highlight significant divergence in the ways that students and teachers conceptualize the role of student-centered talk in the classroom.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:34Z (GMT).

The socio-scientific issue writings from the students that had the modeling lesson in-between showed growth in their consideration of causal interactions, while students from the other two classrooms did not.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:36Z (GMT).

The data draw from a teaching experiment contrasting student-driven (n=25) and teacher-guided inquiry (n=27) with primary school students. In groups, children evaluated data comparing two online search engines to argue which one was “best”. In interviews, teacher-guided inquiry groups reported greater discord (personal attack) than student-driven inquiry. Further, teacher-guided inquiry groups were largely unable to recollect the mathematical arguments under debate while their student-driven counterparts could do so with specificity. These outcomes, alongside classroom video analyses of representative debates, demonstrate that when dissent devolves into discord, the value of debate for disciplinary learning can erode. Although debate is often associated with civics or science education, this analysis argues the importance of debate as a site for understanding the disciplinary and relational dimensions of children’s experiences of mathematical learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:36Z (GMT).

Fourteen graduate students in a game design course used StudyCrafter during a 5-week-long unit on designing and conducting experimental research studies. Analyses of pre and posttests, and of students’ written post-unit reflections, showed that students’ confidence and abilities in designing research studies increased, but not their abilities to critique studies.

We document two types of learning about crosscutting concepts. The first is focused on intuitions that provide a causal explanation, while the second focuses on coherent conceptual systems that are refined over time. In both cases there is an intertwined relationship between multiple crosscutting concepts, with some foregrounded or backgrounded. The results provide a new perspective on three-dimensional science learning that incorporates crosscutting concepts and relevant learning mechanisms.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:38Z (GMT).

This study explores the evidence that K-3 teachers use to support their perceptions of students. Analysis revealed that teachers relied on a variety of evidence, used different types of evidence for different students, and used certain types of evidence more often when they perceived a misalignment between students’ performance in math class and aptitude for math. While this highlights potential for teachers to think deeply and in complex ways about their students, it also raises concerns that teachers may tend to characterize students as being certain types of math learners. Expanding the sources of evidence that teachers draw upon when describing students may open up the possibility for more students to be seen by their teachers as developing mathematicians.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:40Z (GMT).

We analyze the case of Kira, a 7th grader who learned to design and 3D print an original fidget spinner and began to imagine herself as a designer and entrepreneur.  Kira’s story came to a surprising and sad end, as she failed to produce the “evidence of learning” required for a high grade.

This study demonstrates a computational approach to modeling identity in an open, online network of ed-tech innovators. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is combined with post hoc qualitative analysis to represent and make sense of online identity profiles as composites of seven latent network discourses.

Data were coded and analyzed to produce themes related the ways in which these youth engaged in the problem definition work.  Presented analysis discusses how youth leveraged personal and community knowledge within problem definitional work. This study suggests youth bring their everyday knowledges to bear in problem definition, while simultaneously developing technical orientations to the work.

Given the challenges with defining EBAS, it is not surprising that existing metrics are criticized for their lack of reliability and validity. One solution is to examine students’ authentic science practices as a proxy for EBAS. Our prior work suggested that practices in Science Classroom Inquiry (SCI) simulations, a computer-based authentic science inquiry experience, are reflective of EBAS. Here we extend our prior work to include an additional practice: hypothesis revision. Students who revised their hypothesis also had more sophisticated epistemological beliefs regarding the lack of a universal scientific method, but not the tentative nature of science knowledge. This study supports the use of practice-based assessments of difficult to measure cognitive constructs such as EBAS and suggests interesting future directions regarding evidence usage and epistemological beliefs about science.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:44Z (GMT).

This paper presents initial work on adult engagement in children’s museums, the stances they take, and how the environment may impact these stances. To do so, we build off both Falk and Storksdieck’s (2005) contextual model for learning and Shina and Acosta’s (2000) categorization of adult pretend play in children’s museums. Results suggest that adults take on many roles, shifting quickly between being playmates, educators, and timeouts. Adult stances are influenced by the environment as well as personal reasons for visiting the museum and their knowledge and interests. While previous research highlights children’s islands of expertise as a way for adults to relate museum exhibits to a child’s life, we suggest that the adults’ islands of expertise and interest also play an important role on what stances the adults take and meaning making.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:45Z (GMT).

In particular, we offer the theory of complex embodiment (Siebers, 2008) to help theorize embodiment as we work to understand the role of disability in learning mathematics. Disabilities such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are often understood as either medical, completely within the individual body, or socially constructed, completely outside the individual body and located in social practices. Yet ADHD is both profoundly experienced and embodied, and yet simultaneously socially constructed through cultural practices of schooling (Lambert 2019). We work to extend these theoretical frames into sociocultural theory as used within mathematics education, which we argue has lacked a way to understand embodiment as central to learning. As Disability Studies scholar Tobin Siebers wrote, “The disabled body pushes back.”","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:46Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In the context of a comprehensive curriculum and professional development initiative, the educator participates in several different roles, including leadership, curriculum writing, and support of teacher work within schools. Within this setting, identity shifts through social interactions with others running the project, with district administrators, with teachers in schools, with students, and with the materials for the curriculum.

CSA is the process of interrogating the values and impact of sociopolitical systems and re-imagining these systems to create new ethical ways of being. Limited work has explored these interdisciplinary contexts, specifically in history education--a discipline that holds resonance with CSA but is frequently taught through an a-political lens. As a result, I conducted an ethnographic study of a high school history class that incorporated CSA, asking if and how did the integration of CSA into this history classroom influence student disciplinary learning? Through on-going qualitative analysis, initial findings indicate that the integration of CSA led to the emergence of critical history practices. I specifically look at two practices, critical historical argumentation and historical imaginative inquiry, to demonstrate how these interdisciplinary practices deepened student historical disciplinary learning and political and ethical meaning-making.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:48Z (GMT).

To describe status changes in authority of students in small groups, this article applies Langer-Osuna’s influence framework (2016) to data of undergraduate students. This analysis found that these components change both longitudinally across days and rapidly within one day. These changes to students’ positions suggest that not all interactions lead to the development of a singular identity (Langer-Osuna, 2018). These findings are consistent with positioning theory, which posits that identity is rapidly in flux as people position and reposition themselves (Davies & Harre, 1999; DeJarnette & Gonzalez, 2015).","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:49Z (GMT).

Scripts are an instructional mean to foster collaborative processes. In this paper, we used adaptive and static information sharing scripts to facilitate the pooling of information during collaborative diagnosing. In total, 159 medical students were randomly distributed to one of three groups (adaptive, static, or no information sharing script). The results showed that both scripts increased the information sharing performance. However, only learners supported with an adaptive information sharing script were able to transfer their knowledge.

The analysis of students’ answers to three open-ended questions revealed that most of the students have inaccurate and imprecise beliefs related to the workplaces, skills, and practices of scientists within the social sciences and humanities. An Epistemic Network Analysis demonstrated that these inaccurate beliefs are even stronger in students who reported to be interested in studying social sciences.

We examine the associations between SRL strategies and performance in a digital literacy platform, Actively Learn, for K-12 education. This platform gives students opportunities to engage in SRL and collects trace data on their use of the system. We examined four SRL-related features from 14,575 students’ activity data. We applied hierarchical linear models using assignment scores as the outcome variable. We found that all SRL strategies have positive associations with science score and that these associations are stronger for short-answer score than for multiple choice question scores. Our results support the construct validity of log measures of SRL and offer insights into how the benefits of SRL may vest differently depending on assessment type.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:50Z (GMT).

We wanted to understand the ways in which young peoples’ prior knowledge about and experiences with animals and animal care could serve as a pathway into engineering and computing, particularly for non-dominant individuals who might not otherwise see themselves as belonging in these disciplines. Here, we present a single case study of Latina adolescent to address the following question: How did engagement in the Animal Investigators camp affect Latina adolescents’ perceptions of what STEM is and who can do it? In the discussion, we address what we can learn from the adolescent’s experiences about designing STEM environments that increase identification with STEM disciplines.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:51Z (GMT).

We also examine the overall dynamic of the classroom and the ways that students were interacting with the cubes through observational notes taken during each session. Middle school students participated in four sessions of Rubik’s Cube training designed by the lead researcher and a partner middle school teacher. Results indicate that students improved in their ability to execute two and three-dimensional mental rotation tests.

To investigate this assumption, we develop a case study to examine the patterns of reasoning that fourth grade students employed over the course of an integrated earth science and geotechnical engineering unit in which inquiry and design activities are intended to inform each other. Applying Krist, Schwarz, and Reiser’s (2019) framework, we found ample evidence of mechanistic reasoning during inquiry lessons, but minimal evidence during design activities. This disciplinary difference in types of sensemaking is reasonable, as engineering is focused on creating functional solutions and not on describing phenomena. Supporting mechanistic reasoning during engineering requires reflecting on why designs work, including leveraging intentional strategies for talk and making thinking visible.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:53Z (GMT).

Teachers often use multiple integer instructional models within the same unit, yet little is understood about the impact of each. Thus, this study compared student learning in authentic classrooms randomly assigned to one of two models, each of which was predicted to better support learning of particular constructs. Preliminary results with 70 fifth-grade students suggested that in the short term each model fostered better learning of the predicted construct, yet findings suggest longer-term knowledge was better supported by students who used the particular number line model. These findings were interpreted using embodied cognition to contribute to the growing recognition that how students physically move during instruction influences learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:53Z (GMT).

The prevailing explanation for this is framed in terms of attractive forces—women are drawn to e-textiles because of their alignment with “historically feminine practices” (Buchholz et al., 2014). However, these gender differences may also be due to repulsive forces. Traditional tools and materials may broadcast ambient identity cues that indicate women do not belong. This hypothesis leads to two predictions: (1) Women and girls are less likely to be interested in workshops that involve tools like wires and soldering irons because they associate those tools with feelings of exclusion and alienation, and (2) e-textiles may be more appealing to women and girls because these tools do not broadcast messages of exclusion. We tested these predictions in an online study with 42 university students (22 male, 20 female). We found that “standard” items like soldering irons and wires broadcast ambient identity cues that lowered women’s sense of belonging while having no effect on men. Additionally, we found that e-textiles did not have a similar discriminatory effect. Thus, “standard” items are not neutral, but charged with meaning, and these items broadcast messages to women that they do not belong.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:54Z (GMT).

Despite prevalent assumptions that science and art are incompatible, the thinking practices utilized in these domains intersect in important ways. The program under study leveraged the commonalities among performing arts, science, and engineering by engaging youth in the collective development of performances about social and environmental issues. Longitudinal ethnographic case studies were utilized to understand the complex nature of each participant’s experience in the program, including her lived (enacted) and storied (narrated) relationships with science. The ultimate goal of this study was to understand the potential of a transdisciplinary art-science approach to expand possibilities for Black and Latinx females in science education. Findings suggest that leveraging art and science can provide a means for identity negotiation through creative and collaborative expression.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:54Z (GMT).

Through 20 semi-structured interviews with parents of ASD children and teenagers, we explore potential uses of technology for social skills development among children and teenagers with ASD, and we also investigate how youth with ASD currently integrate technology into their lives.  Our findings include observations about individual preferences in genre, content, and platform, as well as both positive and negative effects that technology use can have on mood and behavior.  Parents also highlighted several avenues of technology preferences that would be useful for intervention designers to leverage, in order to increase user engagement and to both challenge and appeal to users’ areas of social growth and strengths.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:55Z (GMT).

Previous mathematics and science education research and policy documents have treated measurement as solely quantitative: absolute (a number of standard units) or relative (measurement with non-standard units or defining the size of one object in terms of another). Theoretical arguments from information science, statistics, and developmental psychology are employed to support the inclusion of qualitative ways of thinking in measurement. The model includes two qualitative ways of thinking: ordering and grouping, for a total of four ways of thinking. Given that assessment tasks can be posed for each way of thinking, the model implies that there can be 16 types of strategy. Strategies are illustrated with examples from student interviews. The model is also shown to account well for strategies previously reported. Implications for educational practice and research are suggested.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:58Z (GMT).

In a laboratory experiment where code tracing was encouraged, we found that some struggling novice programmers described code tracing as not only cognitively complex, but also in opposition to their self-beliefs. One participant described himself as not a computer, and therefore unfit to execute code like the computer does. Another described himself as not a programmer, and did not value an activity that was only for learning about how code works. We mapped these learners’ self-narratives onto the Eccles Expectancy-Value Model of Achievement Choice to understand how identity relates to the choice to not trace code. While both participants valued what they could create with code, neither valued code tracing. Alternative activities might allow students with these identities to build skills in a way that aligns with their self-beliefs.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:31:59Z (GMT).

One possible context for intervention is the popular video game Minecraft. Minecraft encourages users to engage in spatial manipulation of 3D objects. However, few papers have chronicled any in-game practices that might evidence spatial reasoning, or how we might study its development through the game. In this paper, we report on 11 middle school students’ spatial reasoning practices while playing Minecraft. We use audio and video data of student gameplay to delineate five in-game practices that align with spatial reasoning. We expand on a student case study, to explicate these practices. The identified practices may be beneficial for studying spatial reasoning development in game-based environments and contribute to a growing body of research on ways games support development of important and transferable skills.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:00Z (GMT).

We chose to code inductively for emerging patterns in their discourse to identify moments of shared knowledge construction of complex Earth and Space science topics. Our results found that paraphrasing was a key strategy that students used to reach understanding together and to ensure group members reached consensus. These findings suggest that rephrasing concepts in familiar terms is essential to deriving meaning and being able to utilize new concepts for higher level reasoning and argumentation, and critical evaluation of scientific models.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:01Z (GMT).

The goals of laboratories are formulated in the form of learning performances with associated tasks and evidence statements that explicitly cover multiple dimensions in an integrated fashion. The learning performances specify the content that students need to know and also the focal practices that need to be used to reason about that content. Specific examples of how the evidence statements provide a basis for coding student knowledge will be discussed with data from a laboratory on acid-base titration.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:01Z (GMT).

Maker technologies create opportunities to disrupt the narrative around who can engage in STEM as well as typical classroom teacher-student discourse. In this paper, we examine the experiences of 57 AP physics students engaged in designing and constructing their own physics-based ESCAPE puzzles, inspired by the popular escape room activity games. Findings indicate that these projects had particular meaning to students because of the 1) physical manifestation of their ability to bring an idea of their own creation to fruition and 2) the permanence and usability of the final project, as illustrated when students shared their puzzles with others in the class.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:02Z (GMT).

Our qualitative analysis of student teams’ recorded discussions identified two contrasting cases of individuals’ expectations of their own and of others’ roles, and their differing collaborative outcomes. Findings illuminate how individual expectations can shape collaborators’ epistemological framings and participation, and have implications for supporting interdependent collaboration in other design-based activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:03Z (GMT).

Drawing on retrospective life-story interviews conducted in Farsi, our analysis focuses on the cases of Kamran and Sanaz. We find that for both individuals, albeit in very different ways, engineering offered a specialized status and expanded opportunity in society.

We have designed a block-based computational modeling environment and curriculum, C2STEM, with the aim to support students’ synergistic learning of computing and physics through explorations that reflect scientific practices. Prior work has established positive learning gains in both physics and computing for students using C2STEM, but what does synergistic learning look like in the moment? Do students see themselves as “doing physics,” “doing code,” or both? Do they see themselves as exploring like scientists, or as following rules? To address these questions, we examine video and log data of students from two classrooms as they build computational models. We find moments of synergy where students’ framing shifts fluidly back and forth between “doing physics” and “doing code”. We discuss implications for research and for instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:04Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The practice of physical research enables this company to explore their unknown expressive potential as an ensemble through an iterative process of creating and refining collective, full-body movements. As a case of ensemble learning that foregrounds artistic agency, physical research supports a community of learners (1) to be comfortable and open with “unknowing,” (2) to engage playfully and “absurdly” in their inquiry and (3) to persist collectively in their inquiry over long stretches of time. These three aspects, each difficult to foster and lauded in learning environments, are grounded in the creative and physical nature of physical research. Here and in ongoing work, I argue that this practice can inspire the design of formal and informal learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:04Z (GMT).

The results of this initial investigation are promising, demonstrating that the potential of the index to describe students' revision behaviors, the patterns of knowledge structure change, the degree of mental model modification that connects to the quality of understanding.

The findings suggest that students may hold negative perceptions about hybrid discourses and Spanish in engineering and society in general. Students tended to not associate non-dominant languages with academic ideas.

VCP leveraged a virtual learning environment and supported in-class curricula to facilitate students learning as identity exploration by taking roles of environmental scientists. Course design was informed by Projective Reflection (PR), a theoretical and methodological framework that conceptualizes learning as identity change in digital and non-digital environments. Numeric and text data from the three sessions were collected from 54 students and analyzed using Quantitative Ethnography (QE) techniques to identify patterns of identity exploration enacted over time. Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) was used as a QE technique to visualize the relationships between cognitive and affective PR constructs in each of the three student groups over time. Findings suggested that regardless of design changes in AVLEs, there were similarities and differences in pathways of identity exploration considering the duration of the courses.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:19Z (GMT).

We collected data in the form of video-recorded interactions of facilitators and visitors at the exhibit, interviews with facilitators, and field notes. Drawing from the experience of one facilitator in particular, we showcase that the “when”s of infrastructuring are strongly related to their figured worlds of computing and museums, and also to institutional regulations and norms. We argue that infrastructuring emerges through improvisational actions and patterns of behavior conducted by facilitators, which are bounded simultaneously by their figured worlds and institutional requirements. This study has implications for future work in informal education, bringing to light the complexity of facilitators’ practices in such spaces that will impact both design and learning opportunities in museums and other educational environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:24Z (GMT).

In this study, we focused on analyzing the products students generated as a way to assess how students integrate science in their multimodal narratives. More specifically, we developed an assessment framework that includes two dimensions (science and integration). We applied this framework to assess the 35 products produced by 130 participants in 5 iterations of the program. The results show that about half of the products presented high quality in science integration. Multiple mechanisms were employed in these products to integrate science in their narratives.

These findings suggest that teachers may not need to design assignments with large, outside audiences to support students’ motivation to revise, but that even an audience of one, and in particular a community member with whom the student has a relationship, can provide motivation for student writers.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:28Z (GMT).

We draw on recent interventions in the learning sciences which orient to emotionality, especially Vea’s approach to guided emotional participation, to show how emotion shaped the learning trajectories of youth activists. We argue that learning to be angry and express outrage through snarky humour-- was a learning process/target/outcome that enabled participants to become feminists by enabling educational intimacy and fostering politicized trust.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:29Z (GMT).

Two forms of instructional prompts were compared: functional prompts to manipulate the models in ways that explored how the fossil may have functioned, and general prompts to manipulate the models in ways that help answer the scientific question. Results suggest that functional prompts encouraged different participant interactions with tangible models, but not with digital models.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:35Z (GMT).

Thus, identity and the extent to which it is considered compatible with STEM engagement is a fundamental issue of access.  Studies suggest that the Maker Movement is a promising venue through which to build pro-STEM identities across diverse groups.  Through the inclusion of materials that are not typical of traditional STEM activities (e.g., electronic textiles, recycled materials), Making creates opportunities to integrate individual and cultural identities into STEM work.  However, successfully integrating and scaling up Making into formal school settings requires robust quantitative evidence that is typically valued in policy circles. This paper reports on the development and initial validation of a new approach to quantify shifts in multifaceted identity that are locally meaningful to participants in Making contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:37Z (GMT).

We address the following question: How can grounding learning activities in girls’ identities provide an entry point for practicing computational thinking? We present findings from a qualitative study of CompuGirls, an informal technology program for girls of color (ages 13-17) that is implemented in collaboration with three public libraries. We highlight a lesson designed to connect CT practices to self-knowledge by examining girls’ complex identities using decomposition and abstraction. Our findings indicate that grounding learning activities in girls’ identities facilitated personal reflection supported the transfer of disciplinary practices from a personal context to a STEM context.

This work recognizes the need for instructors to not only support students in makerspaces, but also to personalize their approach in helping students. We designed a weekly personalized intervention cycle based on students’ self-reported stated learning challenges and learning experiences. The effect of such personalized intervention was then evaluated using a repeated measure ANOVA. Findings suggest that students receiving personalized interventions expressed a lower sense of community. This suggests that while data can support the personalized assistance, a more nuanced approach may be needed to avoid unintended consequences. Overall, this research represents additional effort in the direction of personalization and an initial step towards augmenting teacher decision-making with data.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:45Z (GMT).

While it is expected that students are given free rein to work on their projects, instructors are left with the uncertainty of whether students are in need of assistance. Instructors have to strike a difficult balance between micromanaging students and simply leaving them without any form of instructional support. Here we propose the use of Kinect sensors to consistently and continuously monitor students’ social interactions within makerspaces so that instructors can gain a more comprehensive view of their progress. Overall, the examination of type and diversity of social interactions affords instructors an early opportunity to identify struggling students.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:55Z (GMT).

Knowledge building communities (KBCs) are a growth-promoting pedagogy, suitable to address these challenges. Yet, developing students’ identities as knowledge builders remains undertheorized. In this study, we rise above existing frameworks of fixedness and fluidity to elucidate how students and communities develop growth orientations. Using a grounded theoretical approach, we examined a KBC of graduate students, coding 324 relevant utterances that were expressed by the 18 students over the course of a semester. This resulted in a five-category model of fixedness and growth in KBCs that was then used to describe the overall development of the community as well as the transformation of one student. This study advances both theoretical and practical ideas about how to prepare students for life in the rapidly-changing world.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:32:56Z (GMT).

Statistical difference verification and correlation analysis was performed subsequently. Study shows significant difference of cognitive load between two groups. In comparison group, the variables related to fixation and saccade have a significant correlation with learning achievement. There was no correlation between the indicators of cognitive load and learning performance in the experimental group. However, there have been differences in the kinds of indicators that correlate with performance between two groups, indicating that the variables related to cognitive load may differ depending on the supporting factors available to learners.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:01Z (GMT).

At the same time, academic writing is prone to procrastination. In this paper, we compare how a low trait procrastinator and a high trait procrastinator differ in their affective results and reported procrastination behavior during their first collaborative academic writing process. Focusing on two cases, we investigate how they self-reflect about their academic writing process. We find that the high procrastinators have a more negative affect and report more procrastination behavior. In general, the academic writing process comes for both cases with similar emotional experiences and difficulties. However, we find that the low procrastinator reflects more elaborate, especially regarding emotions during the process, coping strategies for dealing with difficulties, and the role of collaboration partners and social aspects. This detailed analysis may help to develop specific support tools for students to avoid unpleasant emotions that may start a vicious cycle of procrastination behavior in academic writing.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:05Z (GMT).

In this study, we take up multisitedness both spatially and temporally, as memories evoke both other places and past times. Applying this viewpoint to a community of diaspora learners, we look to understand the ways in which collective memories negotiate learning in sites dislocated from the cultural and geographical center of the practice.  We present the case of an advanced Carnatic singing class in an East Coast North American city. The participants of interest in the class are learners returning to the practice after a break, having learnt the art form growing up in South or Southeast Asia. Adopting a multisited lens on videos of class sessions and participant interviews, we explore how collective memory realizes specific forms of the practice and hybridizes it in the process.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:06Z (GMT).

In this study, we developed an augmented reality device we called DoggyVision that lets people see the world similar to dogs’ vision. We designed a scavenger-hunt for families where they explored indoor and outdoor environments with DoggyVision, collected data firsthand, and drew conclusions about the differences between how humans and dogs see the world.

We extend this research by leveraging a syncretic approach (Gutiérrez & Jurow, 2016) to blend scientific modeling practices with everyday translanguaging practices in a generative way that leverages linguistic diversity in service of inquiry. In a design study conducted in a 6thgrade STEM classroom as part of a 9-week ecology unit, we explore the ways that students appropriated and transformed modeling and translanguaging practices. We focus on two syncretic practices that capitalize on parallels between modeling and translanguaging: (a) translating as a part of modeling and (b) using language and conversation as metaphors for interpreting and creating multimodal models. In this context, syncretic modeling and translanguaging practices contributed to productive science discourse by helping students (a) to understand complex phenomena, (b) to express ideas, and (c) to legitimize diverse linguistic and representational practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:08Z (GMT).

Targeting cognitive rather than behavioral variables allows these tools to go beyond observable processes. Thus, tool designers have to make a number of relevant decisions on how to select, collect, transform and present the group awareness information. Because these decisions are so manifold, existing tools differ vastly and it is near to impossible to compare overall tool effects. Thus, in this paper, we conducted a literature search returning 25 papers describing 18 cognitive Group Awareness Tools. We then analyzed these tools with regard to data processing from a psychological perspective to identify key decisions that may affect the learners’ collaborative learning processes. This allows us to systematically disentangle the effects of specific data processing decisions on tool functions to ultimately deduce guidelines for tool design.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:09Z (GMT).

The results from a design experiment in a sixth-grade classroom showed that students exhibited reasoning that integrated science and mathematics and avoided the typical naïve conceptions about the water cycle. Specifically, students engaged in covariational and multivariational reasoning as they coordinated the simultaneous change of the quantities involved in the water cycle. They also exhibited transitive reasoning in terms of those quantities and relational reasoning connecting the water cycle to other science content. These forms of reasoning illustrate the power of mathematical reasoning for helping students construct an advanced understanding of the water cycle phenomenon. The findings also show that the context of science helped students to construct advanced forms of mathematical reasoning about quantities, illustrating the reciprocal relationship between math and science learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:09Z (GMT).

Yet, many institutions do not have enough classrooms outfitted with furniture that provides ideal support for collaborative interactions over shared course materials. Consequently, many instructors teach in classrooms with furniture that may not afford effective collaboration. Does classroom furniture affect undergraduate students’ learning from courses that utilize active-learning approaches? We explored this question in three undergraduate chemistry courses that placed a focus on collaboration with shared physical and virtual resources. 2,651 students in 136 sections were taught in classrooms with different furniture: traditional tables, traditional chairs, group chairs with or without wheels, and group tables with monitors. We found that low-performing students had significantly higher course grades if their classroom had group tables or flexible chairs. Further, a survey with teaching assistants revealed how teaching strategies may compensate for suboptimal classroom furniture.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:10Z (GMT).

This paper reports on an experimental investigation of an embodied molecular visualization in organic chemistry aiming to teach students about the spatial concept transformation. The study compared two groups: one group received spatial training instruction on transformation with embodied actions in the molecular visualization environment and a control group observed video captures from the same visualization. Comparisons of pre-/post- scores on mental rotation of molecular stimuli pairs showed no difference between the groups on ability to transform molecules post-intervention. We discuss possible explanations for the failure to observe learning in the present study and suggest possible gaps in embodied theory, namely around considering timescales of spatial learning and how embodied learning may interfere with prior conceptions.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:11Z (GMT).

Despite differing formats, early childhood coding tools rely heavily on a similar representational infrastructure. Grids and arrows predominate, introducing a nested series of directional symbols and spatial skills children must learn in order to code. Thus, learning to think computationally is entangled with learning to think spatially and symbolically. This paper analyzes video of Kindergarten students learning to use robot coding toys and examines how they navigated programming’s representational infrastructure. We found that children drew on conventional notions of how objects move, creating a “conceptual blend” for programming robot routes (Fauconnier & Turner, 1998). We argue that coding in Kindergarten requires mapping a series of correspondences from the domain of everyday movements onto the resources available in the representational domain.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:12Z (GMT).

Drawing on evidence from two cases where teachers made adaptations to high quality instructional materials during the Analyzing Instruction in Mathematics through the Teaching for Robust Understanding (AIM-TRU) model for professional learning, we analyze the interplay between the teacher, instructional materials, and other participants as they took an integrity perspective to the curriculum, based on understanding the conceptual framework that underlies its design. In doing so, we show how professional learning effects implementation of materials positively when specific design choices are made.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:12Z (GMT).

We worked with a sample of 35 elementary school students in two groups, experiencing one of the teaching approaches: structured versus unstructured ER curriculum. We employed a mixed-method approach based on video and screen recorded data from eight ER lessons, post-experience focus-group interviews, and post-experience questionnaires on students’ engagement and debugging skills. Findings show that there is a list of errors commonly made by students in both groups. Moreover, the unstructured curriculum group was associated with significantly higher amount of errors than the structured curriculum group. Also, a structured curriculum was related to significantly greater efficiency in finding and debugging errors. However, the results revealed that students in the unstructured curriculum outperformed the structured curriculum in terms of their engagement levels.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:13Z (GMT).

To investigate this inquiry, we employed a mixed analysis method to approach the data coming from an experimental study. The quantitative findings showed that lower-level students performed better in the post-assessments for AR groups than for control groups. Qualitative analyses were conducted to explore how AR facilitated the lower-level students’ learning. The current findings suggested that: the AR’s feature of distributed labor, openness, real-time feedback, and operational symbolic items sustained the lower-level students to engage with higher-level students in problem-solving activity inclusively, jointly, and authentically.","Made available in DSpace on 2020-07-09T04:33:14Z (GMT).
