Additional scaffolding may or may not be needed to ease or problematize tasks that involve intuitive bodily experiences. In this study, a tablet app (“Proportion”) is supposed to enable two novices (about 10 years old) to collaboratively construct an understanding of proportional relations. In a 2×2 factorial design (n = 162), effects of facilitating strategy prompts (with / without) and problematizing verbalization prompts (with / without) regarding the variables task focus, emotions, quality of dialogue and learning gains have been investigated. While the strategy prompts did not have any significant influence, the verbalization prompts had versatile effects: On one hand, quality of talk was improved, on the other hand, task focus and emotions were negatively affected. Learning gains were limited to near transfer task types and comparable over conditions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:48:32Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, very little is known about the actual, everyday use of ubiquitous social network technologies for learning and study purposes in secondary schools. In the present work, we present findings from two survey studies on representative samples of Israeli, Hebrew-speaking teenagers (N = 206 and N = 515) which explored the scope, characteristics and reasons behind such activities. Findings show that such practices can be described best as online knowledge sharing, that is: the up- and downloading of knowledge and knowledge sources to social network peer groups. This teenage, school-related knowledge sharing is common and widespread, entails different types of knowledge, and is mainly motivated by prosocial motives, as well as expectations for future reciprocation. Sharing is predicted by individual differences, such as gender, collectivist values, mastery goal orientations and academic self-efficacy. Relations between competitive-individualist values and sharing are more complex, and are, among others, moderated by expectations for future benefits. Implications for educational practices and for collaborative learning theories are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:39Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Data were shared with participants the following day as fodder for discussion about data literacy, visual representations, and information processing. The eye-tracking activities helped make visible and public students' private visual strategies. Utilizing these data and other multi-modal representations, students participated in a collaborative, metacognitive, reflective process regarding their own visual strategies, the mental processes of others, and comparisons within. This activity was one of an ensemble of technological activities and artifacts that afforded students a way to collaboratively engage with otherwise private, and often tacit thoughts. Results of this work in progress suggest that this sort of computer-supported intervention could be used productively to enhance student multi-semiotic discourse and collaborative reflective inquiry.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:41Z (GMT).

The environment was designed to enable learners to explore models of evolutionary shifts through domain-specific agent-based visual programming. It was implemented as a curricular unit in seventh grade science class. We analyzed video and log data of two contrasting student pairs. This paper presents one of our findings: Development of modular core functional code-units or what we call anchor code. Anchor code is a body of code that creates a stable base from which further explorations take place.

To help students diversify their repertoire of ideas, we engaged students in a cooperative activity in which individual students chose to investigate one of three possible topics (meat-eating, albedo, or ozone), and then reported back to their peers. Students investigated Netlogo (Wilensky, 1999) models that included features relevant to their chosen topic. After exploring one of the computer models, students met in jigsaw groups (Aronson & Patnoe, 2011). Results on assessment items matched to each investigation show that scores improved across all topics for all students. However, students in the meat-eating investigation show more improvement for the meat-eating item, while students who investigated albedo and ozone performed equally well on all items. These findings suggest that the jigsaw activity helped all students learn about the causes of climate change from their peers.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:44Z (GMT).

To uncover the degree of asymmetric collaboration, the social entropy index (the sum of relative participation proportions of each individual) was adopted in some studies, but only quantitative indicators (e.g., the number of characters) were considered in the measurement. In this study, we define participation evenness plus the dimension of the quality of students’ notes as “idea evenness”. Adopting the entropy and using the depth of understanding within students’ theorizing notes as the parameter, we analyzed the idea evenness of five Knowledge Building communities. We found that the idea evenness values are high in four of the communities and can reflect the different distributions of students’ depth of understanding in different communities. The results indicate that students participated in theorizing evenly in most knowledge building communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:45Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However when new pedagogy and technology are introduced, it may not be easy for teachers to thrive in such complex environments. It is therefore important to identify key knowledge bases required for teachers to teach effectively in new CSCL environments. Using the lens of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), the paper will examine two case studies of teachers who co-designed a CSCL tool for teamwork with a research team and implemented it in their classrooms. The paper reveals the interacting components of technology, pedagogy and content knowledge, and highlights strengths as well as growth areas for the teachers’ further professional development. Through identifying and then building these knowledge layers, teachers will be able to harness tools and co-design proficiently and successfully in technological environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:46Z (GMT).

The video-based study was conducted during an hour-long afterschool learning sessions over three weeks. Episodes of learners’ collaborative argumentation practices were analyzed by examining talk, body formation, gestures, and tool handling. The findings expand current research on argumentation by describing and characterizing the collaborative argumentation practices that occurred during M&T. Findings also contribute an understanding of collaborative argumentation as a theoretical framework to expand constructionism.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:46Z (GMT).

Two researchers collaborated with a group of high school students with a shared goal of designing school technology practices that were meaningful to the students. Informed by theories of infrastructuring forms of participatory design (Le Dantec & DiSalvo, 2013), the collaboration explicitly sought to re-mediate the social relations of designing the school’s organizational practices with technology. This study analyzes the development and implementation of a student-designed school technology practice as a case study to examine how infrastructuring forms of participatory design mediated shifts in power relations and organizational practices at the school site. Results indicate that forms of participatory design which seeks to address social relations in the process and outcomes of design can contribute to shifts in student roles within the school and facilitate boundary crossing (Akkerman & Bakker, 2011) in which student goals were reflected in new organizational technology practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:47Z (GMT).

Their conceptual understanding was collected through pre- and post-testing and evaluated by using the structure–behavior–function framework. SSNA revealed that higher conceptual understanding was related to improved collective knowledge advancement. Further in-depth discourse analysis clarified that students who acquired higher conceptual understanding engaged in shared epistemic agency through productive regulatory processes to promote their collective knowledge advancement. Based on the results, we discuss and propose scaffoldings for more students to engage in productive collaboration in jigsaw instruction.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:48Z (GMT).

Challenges and goals were measured using a modified version of AIRE (Järvenoja, Volet, & Järvelä, 2013). Using a mixed methods exploratory approach, preliminary results showed that teams whose members (a) interacted with more positive social-emotional interactions (b) reported more team-oriented goals, and (c) had prior familiarity with each other, reached higher levels of mutual trust and shared mental models.

Organizational theories and research are increasingly focused on multilevel perspectives for creating actionable knowledge; the challenge is to take advantage of emergence to self-organize around solutions and new means. By “innovation networks” we mean networks that go beyond sharing and discussion to the actual creation of new knowledge and innovations. Self-organization and emergence surround us, all the time and at multiple levels, whether we are aware or not. However, self-organization around idea improvement is rare and requires engaging innovative capacity at all levels, a research-intensive enterprise surrounding innovations, and an open source engineering team committed to enabling new forms of interaction, media, and analytic tools. “Multi-level” envisions inclusion of students, teachers, administrators, researchers, engineers, and policy makers in a collaborative enterprise.

Learning Analytics (LA) focuses on the collection, measure and analysis of data about learners and their contexts (Long & Siemens, 2011). LA tools are normally rooted in probabilistic/frequency-based approaches. These are themselves incapable of capturing the meaning of texts at any level, because probabilities do not constitute natural language semantics.  \  \ Therefore, semantic related analytics seems to be a promising approach. Not only to get insight in the process of knowledge building as a support for students and teachers in this collective process but also as a possibility for assessment. Not to control but to mirror and feed forward the semiotic collaborative process of building an understanding that makes a difference for how students look at and act in our world.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:51Z (GMT).

However, it had not been widely used in the community. Most of the works done in the direction of understanding collaborative cognition are majorly based on the qualitative methods. Research has shown that the collaborative gaze data can be used as an alternate source of information to assess collaboration. Once, we understand the how the gaze data reflects the collaboration quality and success, we could design gaze-aware systems to support remote/collocated collaboration. In this symposium, we bring together five papers that use eye-tracking data as a proxy for communication and cognition during remote/collocated collaborative learning and propose design of gaze-aware systems.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:52Z (GMT).

We are opening our data to the CSCL community and introducing the procedures to request access to the data. ECSAP was developed to explore the assessment of collaborative problem solving (CPS) competency through a large-scale and standardized approach. The goal of this symposium is to examine research questions that are of interest to the CSCL community, such as how CPS skills and collaborative patterns interact with performance outcomes, and how prior content knowledge and personality of team members affect the collaboration process and outcomes. In our study, we collected both individual and collaborative responses (~1500 responses) to the ECSAP instruments. We present our study findings that used new methodologies in psychometrics and followed the best practices of psychometrics and statistics.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:54Z (GMT).

This symposium undertakes a fresh analysis based on the relations between two widely adopted approaches that may be poles apart but arguably viewed as variations within a common applied epistemological framework. The two approaches are scripted collaboration and Knowledge Building. Rather than focusing on similarities and differences, the symposium will address deeper problems such as reconciling external supports of all kinds with the self-organizing character of knowledge construction and integrating such supports into classrooms viewed as knowledge-creating communities. The centerpiece of the symposium is a panel discussion that includes experts who provide different theoretical viewpoints. In its synthesis the symposium will capture and make sense of what is strongest in the two approaches and provide a broad conceptual basis for next-generation initiatives.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:54Z (GMT).

We synthesize that work to highlight specific ways that technology-mediated classroom tools can focus and stabilize teachers’ attention on valuable aspects of student thinking emphasized by current reform efforts. We then illustrate TMTN with classroom examples in which technology supported or obstructed teachers' attention to student thinking, and consider implications for research on technology in teacher practice, professional development, and the design of technological tools for K-12 classrooms.  \","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:55Z (GMT).

For girls who had developed an interest in a computing career by the end of middle school, interest in computing increased. Aspirational expressions of interest, defined as stating an interest in computing, were highly correlated while embodied expressions of interest, defined as engaging in computing activities such as classes, clubs, or hobbies were generally not correlated. Participants appeared more definite in their attitudes towards computing by the end of high school, particularly interest in computing as a career and college major, than they had at the end of middle school.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:56Z (GMT).

First, they can provide collaboration scripts that adaptively react to student actions and prompt them to engage in effective collaborative behaviors. Second, collaboration often involves multiple visual representations. But many students have difficulties in making sense of representations. Educational technologies can support students in doing so by adapting to how they construct, interpret, and connect representations. We conducted a quasi-experiment with 61 undergraduate chemistry students to test the effectiveness of an adaptive collaboration script that prompts students to discuss visual representations. A control condition collaboratively solved worksheet problems with multiple visual representations without a collaboration script. An experimental condition solved the same problems using an educational technology with the script. The experimental condition showed significantly higher learning gains on a transfer posttest and on complex questions on a midterm exam three weeks later.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:57Z (GMT).

Many innovative approaches to classroom design come with the intention that practices of the people who are experts in a domain are enculturated by classroom students. This idea, known as authenticity, has been carefully conceptualized in a large variation of educational settings. Cognizant of the inherent gap between conceptualizations and their implementation, we used a constant-comparative method to analyze different variations of authentic learning designs. With the aim of bridging this research-practice gap, our analysis resulted in a model of cultural interaction within learning environments based on different configurations of participants and settings. The conceptual contribution of our research is a refined framework of authenticity that foregrounds the role of human interaction in cultural mediation. Practically, our model contributes new insights into the design of authentic learning environments.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, little research has investigated the benefits of combining individual and collaborative learning, as compared to learning only individually or only collaboratively. With our study, we address this research gap. We compared a combined condition to individual-only or collaborative-only learning conditions using intelligent tutoring systems for fractions. The study was conducted with 382 4th and 5th grade students. Students across all three conditions had significant learning gains. However, the combined condition had higher learning gains than the individual or collaborative condition. This difference was more pronounced for 4th grade students than for 5th grade students. In addition, we found that students in the combined condition expressed higher situational interest in the activity compared to those working individually and the same as students working only collaboratively. Through a combination, we may support better student learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:57:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, when these discussions are reading-centered and hosted in traditional threaded discussion forums, it is often difficult to maintain focus on the readings themselves, as well as navigating the difficulty of attributing ideas to just one discussion post within a thread. This study demonstrates how an anchored annotation system was used in a first semester online, asynchronous doctoral course to support more effective reading-centered knowledge construction. We investigated the discussion activities of 12 online doctoral students as they explored seven articles during two non-consecutive weeks.  Through analysis of 591 student comments and replies, we examined how students used the anchoring system as a support to help make sense of the articles. We found that using anchored annotation reduced coordination activities and supported knowledge construction, particularly interpretation and elaboration of ideas.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:00Z (GMT).

However, the impact of visualizing partner-related information and content-related information in such tools is barely investigated separately. Thus, we compared the impact of both types of information on collaborative learning in an experimental study (N = 120) by systematically varying partner-related information (given or not) and content-related information (given or not) in a 2x2 design. Concerning communication behavior, we found no effect of content-related information, but a main effect of partner information indicating that the visualization of a learning partner’s knowledge deficit implicitly guides learners to give longer explanations. A qualitative comparison contrasting learners with the highest and lowest knowledge gain indicate that content-related information could still be relevant for implicit guidance, since successful learners seem to use this information for addressing topics in their explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:02Z (GMT).

Since models cannot represent all known and unknown aspects of how nature operates, claims based on model-based data inevitably contain uncertainty. This study explores (1) how high school students attribute sources of uncertainty when prompted as part of an argumentation task and (2) how intelligent feedback may guide them to become more cognizant about deep uncertainty associated with model-based data. Phenomenological analyses of students’ uncertainty attributions (N = 840) identified five distinct patterns: self-introspection, personal theories and experiences, data source acknowledgement, scientific description based on singular causal accounts and frequency of observations, and deep uncertainty based on epistemic or ontic accounts. Discourse captured on video illustrated how intelligent feedback enhanced uncertainty attribution.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:02Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Eleven teachers infused the curriculum into technology, math, engineering, library and art courses. We investigated how teachers modified the curriculum to fit their respective standards and students’ needs. We discuss the challenges they faced and propose ways of addressing these barriers. We found that the teachers were successful in combining digital literacy skills with computer science—not only to facilitate students’ learning, but also to connect with their diverse ethnic backgrounds and their contemporary passions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:03Z (GMT).

Scales were input into mixed multi-level models to predict 12 aspects of the way students communicated in their course-based collaborative discussions of business cases. Results based on a sample of 1565 posts showed that students with weaker context-based orientations posted messages that showed greater levels of reasoning, hard evidence use, autonomous tone and linear argument structures. In addition, the local discussion group context moderated the relationship between students’ degree of collectivistic orientation and how they referred to and agreed with each other, as well as their expressions of social presence. Findings highlight the group/individual interplay in understanding relationships between cultural orientations and collaborative communication.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:04Z (GMT).

This paper examines how people collaboratively scientize through a massively multiplayer mobile game called Pokémon GO. For three months, we conducted observations of online communities around Pokémon GO and examined how crowdsourcing engagements in these communities can lead to science inquiry. We adhered to the standards of a comparative case study to examine three exploratory cases of scientizing in online discussion about Pokémon GO. These examples include crowdsourcing collaborations to compare multiple data sets, countering misinformation, and creating mapping sets. We demonstrate how aspects of these online engagements follow authentic and simple science inquiry. Furthermore, the implications of our research for informal science learning are especially meaningful for understanding how Pokémon GO can be used to motivate scientizing practices in families and children.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:05Z (GMT).

As opposed to traditional pen and paper tests, we designed a series of hands-on task that participants complete before and after a maker workshop. In this paper, we contrast high-school students’ performance with experts (graduate students in mechanical engineering) and found evidence that the students’ behavior became more similar to experts’ after participating in a maker workshop. For the scope of this paper, we focus on a single task and describe in detail our coding scheme and analyses. Additionally, we show how a combination of qualitative and computational analysis helped us develop metrics to compare novices’ and experts’ performances. We conclude by discussing the potential of this type of assessment for supporting students’ learning in makerspaces. \","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:05Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Interactive displays allow students to collaborate and interact with the content in a natural and engaging manner. Despite the increased prevalence of interactive displays for learning, we know very little about how students collaborate in such settings and how this collaboration influences their performance. In this dual eye-tracking study, with 36 participants, a two-staged within-group experiment was conducted to investigate students’ collaboration and learning gains in an interactive display. The results show that collaboratively, pairs who have high gaze similarity have high learning outcomes. Individually, participants spending high proportions of time in acquiring the complementary information from images and textual parts of the learning material attain high learning outcomes. We show that the gaze is an effective proxy to cognitive mechanisms underlying collaboration not only in formal settings but also in informal learning scenarios.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:06Z (GMT).

To study how learning processes unfolded for eighth grade students collaborating in an e-textbook research activity, we analyzed data sources at individual and group levels using multiple methods, including nonparametric tests, text mining, Markov modeling, and quantitative discourse analysis. Individual measures revealed learning gains on content tests and documentation of shared ideas during collaboration. Group measures revealed increased conceptual discourse over time and streamlining of the research process. Measures at each level indicated distinct paths of inquiry for students and groups; however, these differences were not associated with negative conceptual outcomes. These findings have implications for how we understand how collaborative learning processes unfold, especially between the individual and the group, and how we design support for collaboration and knowledge sharing.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:07Z (GMT).

Research on biology classrooms has shown that different units are often taught in a disconnected way, with little focus on unifying themes (e.g., systems) that connect various concepts together in the study of biology. In this study, we hypothesized that a curricular model based on scientific practices and agent-based simulations to teach biology through a complex systems lens would support students’ coherent understanding of biology. We investigated the extent to which and ways our curriculum supported students’ biology coherence. Units covered topics of diffusion, ecology, enzymes, evolution, genetics, and modeling. Fifty-four students were randomly selected for focus group interviews from a larger study of 463 students. Findings provide promising evidence that students developed a coherent understanding of biology.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

This paper focuses on one important aspect of collaborative dialogue: expressions of uncertainty. In a study of undergraduate novice computer science students working in pairs, we observed that the students who produced the lowest quality solutions expressed uncertainty more often than those who produced middle-quality solutions. Perhaps surprisingly, pairs with the highest quality solutions also expressed more uncertainty than the middle performers. Examining the ways in which students expressed and then followed up on uncertainty revealed that higher-performing pairs utilized emerging learning opportunities when uncertainty was expressed, and remained focused on one task at a time. In contrast, the lower-performing pairs often did not resolve their uncertainty before moving on, attempting to work with multiple incomplete pieces of the solution simultaneously. These findings provide insight into how best to support collaborative learning during uncertainty.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:08Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Our study suggests combining a novel theoretical (Fischer et al., 2014) and a novel methodological (Shaffer et al., 2006) framework to respond to these challenges by detecting epistemic networks of scientific reasoning processes in the context of collaborative vs individual problem solving of pre-service teachers. We investigated (1) whether the combination of these frameworks can be fruitfully applied to model scientific reasoning processes and (2) what unit of analysis researchers or instructors should choose to answer questions of interest. One novel aspect of our study is that we compared epistemic networks in case of collaborative vs individual reasoning processes. Our results show that (1) epistemic networks of scientific reasoning can reliably capture reasoning processes when comparing collaborative vs individual reasoning; and (2) propositional and potentially larger units might be considered as “optimal” units of analysis to detect such differences.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:09Z (GMT).

Cohesion, reflected by the strength of the semantic relations behind the automatically identified links, is assessed using WordNet-based semantic distances, as well as unsupervised semantic models, i.e. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The analysis is built on top of the ReaderBench framework and multiple identification heuristics were compared, including: semantic cohesion metrics, normalized cohesion measures and Mihalcea’s formula. A corpus of 55 conversations in which participants used explicit links between utterances where they considered necessary for clarity was used for validation. Our study represents an in-depth analysis of multiple methods used to identify implicit links and reveals the accuracy of each technique in terms of capturing the explicit references made by users. Statistical similarity measures ensured the best overall identification accuracy when using Mihalcea’s formula, while WordNet-based techniques provided best results for un-normalized similarity scores applied on a window of 5 utterances and a time frame of 1 minute.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:10Z (GMT).

While accessibility is considered important for technology users with disabilities, it is treated as a niche or stigmatized subdomain of technology design. As a result, traditional computer science and informatics curricula do not expose students to the needs of diverse users, and students transition to the workforce unaware of the importance and impact of accessible design. We incorporated accessibility as part of a design thinking course and observed student learning. We sought to challenge notions of accessibility as a niche area, learn methods and barriers for including accessibility in the curricula, and identify impacts on student learning. We found that students grasped general design concepts while designing for users with and without disabilities, and they faced challenges specific to designing for both populations in concert.

They define a rich context of socio-cognitive interactions in which conflict can arise. Supports for conflict awareness and argumentation processes to resolve the conflict can foster learning. This article presents a comparative 2×2 field study (N=98) of such supports in a university course that included weekly SNS discussions. Group Awareness Tools (GATs) were used to increase attitude conflict awareness, and argumentation scripts as a cognitive guidance to help learners capitalize on this awareness and resolve the conflict productively. We use Social Network Analysis (SNA) to gain a group-level understanding of the effects of argumentation on attitude change relative to peer interactions. We measure number of interactions, information flow control, influence distribution, and attitude similarity. Both GATs and argumentation script influence group processes, but argumentation script shows more substantial influence.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:12Z (GMT).

Computer-based scaffolding can play a key role in helping students enhance these skills during PBL. We examined how information literacy, collaboration, and time spent in various scaffolding sections combine to predict argument quality, and qualitative analysis from the social cognitive framework perspective to explain why significant variables predicted argumentation score. Quantitative results indicated that information literacy, time spent doing individual work, and time spent on the scaffold stages define problem and link evidence to claims significantly predicted argument quality. Qualitative results suggest that there was little connection between the content of the written argument and what students wrote in the scaffold when students spent more time in individual work. Results are discussed in light of the literature.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:13Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, in open-ended collaborative small group work where learners make unique solutions to tasks that involve robotics, electronics, programming, and design artefacts evidence on the effectiveness of using these learning activities are hard to find. The paper argues that multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) can offer novel methods that can generate unique information about what happens when students are engaged in collaborative, project-based learning activities. Through the use of multimodal learning analytics platform, we collected various streams of data, processed and extracted multimodal interactions to answer the following question: which features of MMLA are good predictors of collaborative problem-solving in open-ended tasks in project-based learning? Manual entered scores of CPS were regressed using machine-learning methods. The answer to the question provides potential ways to automatically identify aspects of collaboration in project-based learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:14Z (GMT).

The overall aim was to understand how to integrate community-driven science and urban development in school education, in addition to identifying the knowledge and practices that emerged from the process. Our study presents survey data from two 7th grade classes (50 students 13–14 years of age) that developed Minecraft and LEGO models that re-designed their neighbourhood to solve local problems. The results show that, over the course of the project, students became aware of the authentic knowledge they possess about their urban area and that they are able to connect it to structural changes.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:15Z (GMT).

Active learning interventions implement technology and collaboration to engage students actively with the content. Yet, it is unclear how these features contribute to their effectiveness. Research suggests that these features may enhance learning by providing formative feedback. To understand how technology and collaboration support learning by providing formative feedback, we conducted an observational study in a traditional and an active learning version of an undergraduate chemistry course. Results suggest that technology-provided feedback in the active learning intervention enhanced collaboration. We identify specific challenges and opportunities in technology design and active learning interventions for computer-supported collaborative learning research to address.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:16Z (GMT).

SNA applications in learning settings and CSCL scenarios are growing in popularity, which is in-line with new trends in learning analytics. For the CSCL research community, the adoption of SNA techniques as part of the methodological repertoire requires adequate understanding of the core concepts, their potential contributions, and limitations. We started from the hypotheses that (1) most applications of SNA in CSCL research make use of a small set of basic methods; and (2) the discourse related to SNA is partly inadequate or imprecise. To further analyze and corroborate these “issue hypotheses” we have used network analysis techniques in order to reveal relations between SNA measures and specific aspects of CSCL research (activities, contexts, research methods) based on a corpus of 90 published studies. Based on the results we pinpoint specific issues and outline new opportunities.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:16Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

An important open question is how to support effective collaboration and foster equity for students with different levels of incoming preparation. In this study, we compared two collaborative instructional approaches for computer science problem solving, in which students participated in one of two conditions: The Baseline condition featured collaborative problem solving in which students worked in dyads from the beginning of the collaboration; in the other condition, called Think-First, students first worked on the problem individually for a short time and then began collaborating to produce a common solution. The results from 190 students from an introductory programming class working in 95 pair-programming teams demonstrate that this simple modification to pair programming had a significant positive effect on test scores and on substantive contributions in collaborative dialogue.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:17Z (GMT).

Virtual and physical models have different affordances that can be integrated to foster students’ learning. Integrating evidence from multiple models to justify explanations is challenging, and we know little about how students coordinate such information, especially in biology. This study investigated how students’ integrated information from virtual and physical models in a design-based, biology curriculum. Some students used information from virtual simulations in written explanations of changes they would make to their physical models. However, one-third of students did not use the virtual model to justify their revisions, despite prompts from instructional materials, the teacher, and other group members. Even some students who integrated these different models did not initially do this without support from external prompts. This study provided deeper understanding of how students integrated physical and virtual models, which can help identify the kinds of support students may need.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:20Z (GMT).

A system that can measure collaboration in real-time may be useful.  For instance, it could alert an instructor that a group needs attention. We tested whether superficial measures of speech and user interactions of students would suffice for measuring collaboration. As pairs of students solved complex math problems on tablets, their speech and tablet gestures were recorded. These data and multi-camera videos were used by humans to code episodes as collaborative vs. various kinds of non-collaboration.  Using just the speech and tablet log data, several detectors were machine learned. The best had an overall accuracy of 96% (Kappa=0.92), which is higher than earlier attempts to use speech and log data for detecting collaboration. The improved accuracy appears to be due both to our analytic methods and to the particular mathematical task, which involves moving objects.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:21Z (GMT).

Platform design research validated user interest a complementary space for learning within class and wider program communities, and that integrated involvement of parents’ personal social networks. An iterative design process identified tools and activities for initial prototype development, implementation and redesign. The time to identify platform and implementation features necessary to ensure further research proved a benefit. The natural evolution of system roles and supports, comfort with an innovation by parents and staff, and communication about the innovation over time has resulted in a shift in expectations about how learning and support takes place in the program.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:24Z (GMT).

We examined how different graphing activities during science inquiry helped to develop these interrelated abilities in students. Grade 7 students (N=117) worked in pairs on a web-based cell biology unit to either generate or critique graphs of the effects of proposed cancer treatments on cell numbers. All students gained in their graph and science explanation abilities. While students who critiqued graphs gave better overall explanations within the unit, students who constructed graphs better applied their conceptual understanding of science to explain their graphs, both within the unit and later on the post test. We interpret these findings in terms of the relative affordances and constraints of critique and construction activities, and observe students’ common misunderstandings of graphs. This study has implications for designing instruction that supports students’ uses of graphs within science contexts.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:25Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

In peer tutoring, for instance, tutors may avoid providing feedback to their partners to avoid the face-threat to their tutee. In this paper, we explore how the interpersonal closeness between tutor and tutee impacts tutors’ use of indirectness with feedback and instructions, and the impact those moves have on tutees’ problem-solving. We found that stranger tutors use more indirect instructions and provide more positive feedback to their tutee than friend tutors, and that stranger tutees attempted and solved more problems when their tutors used indirect instructions. We found no effect for dyads of friends, suggesting that interpersonal closeness reduces the face-threat of direct instructions. These results demonstrate that designers of CSCL tools should incorporate awareness of students’ relationships into their systems, as that relationship impacts students’ collaborative learning behaviors.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:25Z (GMT).

The objective of this work was to teach young people digital literacies associated with “city science,” an emerging interdisciplinary field that creates data-driven approaches to complicated community issues. Participants were videotaped as they collected and analyzed information about a specific neighborhood using wearable cameras, GPS devices, heart rate monitors, and a GIS software. Early findings show that Mobile City Science uses technology to engage people with diverse perspectives around a community scale problem.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:26Z (GMT).

In an effort to rectify past participatory inequities, we designed a maker workshop for high school youth that capitalized upon multiple digital and physical interfaces to create simultaneously digitally and physically responsive projects, which encouraged team-based distributed creativity and development. We explore how the tools and the curricular design encouraged and fostered collaboration and inclusivity, as well as disrupted previous implicit associations around computing and creativity. We discuss the teams, the projects created and how the learning activities provided opportunities for inclusion and equity.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:28Z (GMT).

However, a review of the literature indicates a lack of empirical studies investigating immersion in relation to the learning process. The present case study characterizes students’ immersive experiences during a location-based augmented reality science activity. Two pairs of students were purposefully selected from a cohort of eighteen 11th graders, due to their diametrically opposing views about their immersive experience. The analysis of students’ discourse during the activity, and of post-activity interviews, yielded a coherent indicator of immersion. To investigate whether each pair’s immersion affected the learning process, we analyzed activity logs, discourse and learning outcome of the two pairs during the collaborative learning process. Findings show that immersion was related to the learning process, dramatically affecting students’ learning behaviors, such as collecting and interpreting the available data, as well as problem-solving patterns.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:29Z (GMT).

This paper reports on the sustained efforts of a self-organizing network of special needs schools in Hong Kong that has worked together for more than a decade to realize the vision of providing the same educational opportunities to children with various degrees of learning disability. The analysis focuses on how their engagement in the development of a collaborative platform for teacher learning started a journey of socio-technical co-evolution that resulted in exponential scaling of the innovation both qualitatively and quantitatively. The evolution trajectory of this network shows characteristics and susceptibilities similar to those in the socio-technical innovation literature.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:30Z (GMT).

In this talk, we attempt to trace the growth of four visible dimensions of the project and the challenges embed within each dimension. Knowledge building practice requires a significant shift from knowledge deepening to knowledge creation paradigm. This particular KB project has been focusing on working with teachers to design and enact idea-centered and collaborative classrooms while tackling all curriculum and assessment demands along with physical and time constraints prevalent in every school. It warrants a detailed study of the areas of growth to ensure symmetry in advancement in all stakeholders in schools and considering all dimensions of schools and teaching and learning processes. This is needed so that intensive innovations, such as KB, have a chance to take root in practice. In fact, creating symmetrical knowledge advancement in all our collaborators and collaborating schools has always been a core principle of design in the research:","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:31Z (GMT).

We present data from a two-week study where two fifth grade classrooms modeled evaporation and condensation. We focus our analysis on one group that experienced success with the activity, and another that struggled; these groups’ intended models emphasized random motion and aggregation respectively, two important but complementary molecular behaviors. Both groups’ ideas were incorporated into a collective model designed in consultation with the entire class. We show that computational modeling (1) often required explicit support, but when leveraged productively (2) served a representational role by supporting the elaboration of student ideas about physical mechanism, and (3) served an epistemic role by allowing students to compare, synthesize, and build on other’s contributions.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:33Z (GMT).

In this study, we examined the online knowledge work of 9-year-olds studying light and shadows. Data triangulation at multiple levels of analysis (e.g., community, students, teacher) was used to validate the COIN concept of rotating leadership to assess students’ collective responsibility for knowledge advancement. Overall, we found many students leading the group at different points in time, facilitating the spread of diverse ideas that enhanced the breadth of community knowledge and the depth of individual learning. Teacher perceptions of classroom dynamics uncovered additional details of student leaders, such as their level of engagement and their learning outcomes. The practical implications of rotating leadership for assessing Knowledge Building community dynamics – such as epistemic agency and collective responsibility – are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:34Z (GMT).

GroupWork was used to facilitate real-time group-based formative assessment and other problem-based activities in the classroom. Specifically, we examine the short-term and long-term impact of this implementation on students’ learning outcomes and experiences compared to performing formative assessments where students work individually. Results show significant performance improvement for each student and for each assessment question when students are allowed to discuss their solutions with peers. The formative assessment grades after collaborative problem solving are shown to have a strong correlation with final course grades, suggesting that collaborative problem solving may have a lasting benefit.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:35Z (GMT).

Half the pairs had been assigned roles (human development or natural resources manager) with associated system controls. Findings showed that explanations by pairs in both conditions often employed collectivist language (“we”) in conjunction with positive reflections on the game-world state using the provided Impact Tool which gave feedback while system was paused. Pairs in the roles condition also gave explanations in response to partner actions and more frequently included negative and action-oriented prospective language about what should be changed moving forward.

We find that generic smartphones are increasingly becoming primary digital assistive devices due to their in-built accessibility features, yet the available information and user guides on these devices is biased towards sighted users. Consequently, device users rely on collaboratively learning from peers for general device familiarity and troubleshooting.  We propose that collaborative learning will likely be a central to technology adoption and maintenance as artifacts and interfaces evolve constantly, forcing people for whose needs the devices may not have originally been designed, to learn and adapt constantly.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:36Z (GMT).

Exhibit designers, like web interaction designers, have long been employing A/B testing of exhibit elements in order to understand the affordances of competing designs in situ. When the exhibit elements being tested are intended to support open-ended group exploration and dialogue, existing knowledge-based metrics like measuring the amount of content recalled don’t quite apply. Visitor groups can explore the educational content in idiosyncratic ways, meaning that not all groups have the same exposure to content, and the learning arises from the visitors’ conversations. In order to evaluate learning outcomes for CSCL exhibits, we present a method for quantifying idiosyncratic social learning, Scoring Qualitative Informal Learning Dialogue (SQuILD), and demonstrate how it was applied to A/B testing of a collaborative data visualization exhibit in a metropolitan museum.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:37Z (GMT).

While students typically do not have issues with understanding simple linear relationships, difficulties arise when more complex relationships are introduced. Richer representational diagrams make visible the complexities within ecosystems and can help students better understand interacting forces. We co-designed an instructional sequence with software applications to support middle school students building interaction food webs as models of ecosystems. 48 students participated in the lessons and used the applications in groups of three to four students. 87% of groups were able to successfully produce an interaction food web. Posttests found that over 80% of students gave a completely or partially correct explanation, demonstrating reasonable proficiency in understanding interaction food webs. The results from each step of the instructional sequence are discussed with respect to the curriculum and technology design.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:38Z (GMT).

We use the Claim Evidence Reasoning framework to establish the suitability of the presentation task for scientific explanations and for evaluating students’ explanations. We show that student groups were proficient in their scientific explanations and effectively used a variety of representation types across all three components of their explanations.

In this work, we examined math collaboration discourse between 11 4th grade dyads in 30-second slices to investigate the relationship between rapport state and reasoning state. Prior to collaboration, students watched one of three instructional videos modeling either domain knowledge, collaborate reasoning, or both. There was no impact of video type on student talk behaviors, nor posttest scores. However, we found a correlation between high rapport states and strong reasoning states, as well as a marginal effect of more co-constructive reasoning leading to improved posttest scores. This work demonstrates that students’ rapport states may play a role in students’ reasoning states, and thus calls for a deeper investigation within the CSCL community about the role of rapport in peer learning.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:40Z (GMT).

Prior research suggests that both network-driven selection patterns (reciprocity and transitivity) and the active selection of specific others are important. Selecting appropriate collaboration partners may moreover require what we call cognitive group awareness, (i.e. knowledge about the knowledge of others). In a field study at two multi-disciplinary scientific events (Alpine Rendez-Vous 2011 and 2013) including N=287 researchers, we investigated selection patterns, looking specifically at career level and disciplinary background, and included a cognitive group awareness intervention. While we could not completely explain how researchers choose with whom they interact, we found that transitivity and interaction duration are relevant for later collaboration. Cognitive group awareness support was beneficial for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration. Career level was a less relevant factor. We discuss measures for supporting newcomer integration and community buildings based on our findings.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:41Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

If the effect of script based support is mainly by means of its effect on collaborative processes, it would be reasonable to expect that if two forms of support manipulate the same process variable, they would provide redundant rather than synergistic effects when offered together. However, explicit forms of scaffolding may provide additional benefits from the reification of the processes that they provide, which could be received as instruction. This paper contributes to research on dynamic support for collaborative learning by proposing a novel form of micro-level prompt designed to elevate the amount of Transactive exchange. In a 2×2 factorial design, we measure the impact of this explicit form of scaffolding and an implicit form of support for Transactive exchange developed in prior work, alone and in combination in terms of impact on two key outcomes, namely collaborative product quality and acquisition of multi-perspective knowledge. In this study, the pair of manipulations provide synergistic support for group product quality, but only the explicit support contributes to acquisition of multi-perspective knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:42Z (GMT).

Existing research suggests that emergent leadership develops when children are given the autonomy and space to regulate group dynamics on their own, which often assists the group to achieve better outcomes within the collaborative activities. However, it is less known whether the emergence of child leadership also promotes deeper and more connected reasoning during collaborative learning. This current study, by coding emergent leadership and relational thinking from two sets of small group discussions (25 in total), revealed that over time, children exhibited more leadership and relational thinking in the second collaborative discussion than their first one. In addition, intellectual leadership moves, rather than organizational leadership moves, were positively related to generation of relational thinking. We discuss the implications of the study to help children, particularly minority children from underserved communities, to developing leadership and relational thinking through participating in intellectually stimulating collaborative discussions.  \  \","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:44Z (GMT).

However, the collaborative and cooperative character of making poses a tension to traditional portfolio assessment that is focused on showcasing individual achievements. Together, this calls for an expanded understanding of the use of portfolios in maker education. We examined the types of portfolio entries at two youth-serving makerspaces (one out-of-school and one in-school), and observed the documentation of personal and shared projects in personal and shared portfolios. Our main findings are that, compared to portfolios that focused on personal work alone, portfolios that included shared projects and documentation presented richer showcases, showing technical and social engagement, assessment by people across a distributed community, and possibilities to narrate work to multiple audiences. This has implications on the facilitation of maker portfolios and broadens portfolio assessment to show the role of the learner in society.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:47Z (GMT).

Scientific peer review panels offer a site of authentic, collaborative decision making among expert scientists, yet no research has examined the impact of videoconferencing on such decision-making practices. We assigned real, de-identified grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to four panels of experienced NIH reviewers, one of which met via videoconference. The videoconference panel was slightly more efficient than the face- to-face panels, but the outcomes of their decision making (i.e., the scores assigned to grant applications) did not differ. However, preliminary analyses suggest there are differences in the nature of the collaborative discussion among reviewers between the two meeting formats. We discuss implications for research into technology-mediated collaborative decision making, as well as for the scientific grant peer review process broadly.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:48Z (GMT).

We anchor our claims in a case example of a cognitive ethnography of an introductory undergraduate history course. We describe how the ways in which learners self-organized and created practices for producing, sharing and reproducing knowledge in the course inform our design of CSCL tools for cultivating historical reasoning practices. This approach identifies points of contact between pre-existing practices and collaborative structures and pedagogical considerations. This enables designers to infuse pedagogical innovations into the activities that local participants already value and perform, achieving benefits akin to participatory design approaches. This can be productive for building on local practices that may be difficult to elicit through design discussions, especially if these local practices are part of learners’ counterculture.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:49Z (GMT).

Collaborative technologies play an increasing role in initial VET. This paper presents a systematic review on the use of CSCL in initial VET. Starting from an initial set of 823 papers, identified in major databases, each paper was coded by multiple researchers to identify demographics (sample sizes, countries, work domains), methods (data sources, technology design) and outcomes (analysis, forms of collaboration). Finally, only 26 papers met our selection criteria, which illustrates that CSCL research is dominated by K-12 and higher education contexts, while vocational learning contexts are under-represented in this field of study. This observation spurs the question if there is anything unique in VET worthy of being investigated through a CSCL framework. Our analysis hints at a positive answer to this question, both for technological and collaborative components.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:50Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Based on dialog analysis of approx. 143,000 comments produced by 2085 participants during one year in twelve blogger OKBCs, this study confirms the use of newcomer integration strategies. Moreover, it refines and structures the analysis instrument, describing three categories of strategies (recruiting activities, practice-oriented interaction, and socializing) with further sub-categories, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of socio-cognitive processes in OKBCs, and potentially to extending Social Knowledge Analytics applications in CSCL.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:51Z (GMT).

One approach is to look at the physical aspects of how students collaborate while engaged in open-ended group-work during Practice-Based Learning (PBL) activities. By analysing how students and teachers move and interact in relation to each other, the space they are in and the objects within it, we can gain a greater understanding of the physical nature of collaborative group-work. This understanding can help us to create a learning environment that intrinsically but unobtrusively supports access by all user profiles who seek to engage with it, thus promoting equity of engagement and participation. Using the example of the design of a Learning Analytics System (LAS) and the educational furniture in which it is implemented, we will show how the physical design of a CSCL implementation can support increased collaboration.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:52Z (GMT).

In this paper, we examine a complementary approach by taking pair programming into a tangible space where pairs coded lights and sensors of an Arduino-based microcontroller, designed programmable and functional circuits, and sewed an electronic textile. We analyzed the reflections of 23 students, who worked in pairs over a series of fifteen 90-minute workshop sessions, about their experiences collaborating and communicating across the different domains of e-textiles creation (e.g., design, circuitry, coding, and crafting). Student perceptions highlighted potential causes of these interactions across these multiple domains, which are distinct from pair programming activities. In the discussion, we address how these perceptions inform the design and development of more equitable pair e-crafting arrangements.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:55Z (GMT).

In this study, we found that students made personal connections when talking about data. Students engaged in data talk across all conversation quality levels, but the ways students interacted and talked about data varied.

Comparing question threads (threads started with questions) and non-question threads (threads that did not start with questions), we noticed that problems posted by students engaged the community in a sustainable and progressive discourse, which is central to collaborative knowledge building. Moreover, the quality analysis of the data revealed that the threads starting with questions were more likely to end up with productive threads compared to the non-question threads.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:58:59Z (GMT).

A classroom study revealed that the effect of tangible puppetry role-play remained in the immediate transfer task; the participants could elicit a variety of voices from possible pupils even in the self-performed role-play, and they did not lose such perspective immediately on their essay.

In this paper, we evaluate a curriculum that encourages middle school students to identify problems that interfere with their daily lives and take action by creating mobile apps to resolve them. We analysed reflections of 13 students, who worked in pairs over a series of twenty-four 45-minute classes, to create mobile apps using App Inventor.

Symbiotic learning partnerships emerge when partners are, as one participant says, vibing with one another: when they are deeply invested in the production of a collaborative media artifact that they will jointly distribute across social media. When vibing with one another, skaters and videographers fall into collaborative, rhythmic cycles. This collaborative mastery is illustrated specifically through a focus on the cycles of reflection and nurture that skaters and videographers enter into when honing their respective crafts. This paper advances understanding of youth digital media production in the rich, yet understudied, action sports community, drawing out potential implications for the design of digital media learning settings, broadly. \","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:04Z (GMT).

For learners in Makers, Making, and 3D printing online communities are vital as most knowledge sharing and problem-solving occurs online. In this study, we examine one online Maker community called SoliForum to better understand how an emphasis on producing physical objects shapes online interaction. Specifically, we investigate what kinds of messages elicit useful responses for those seeking help. We found that, compared to posts that contained only text, posts that contained media elements such as images and videos had a higher response rate and more resolved problems. Based on our analysis we attribute this to the more descriptive and explanatory power of multimedia elements and their ability to represent physical objects. The findings suggest that guidance for crafting messages using multimedia can lead to more equitable participation and learning in online Maker communities.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:05Z (GMT).

Critique can increase student feelings of ownership of science ideas and help students to distinguish between different ideas they may have about how things work. In this paper, we examine how students use their own ideas and ideas from a partner group to revise and improve a physical solar oven they have built using guidance from an online curriculum. We find that students fall into two groups: distinguishing ideas and adding new ideas. Within distinguishing ideas, students can further separated by whether or not they kept only their own ideas or also added the ideas from their partner group. We look at case studies to determine how these groups changed their ideas before, during, and after the critique activity.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:06Z (GMT).

From online multi-player games to social networking sites, instant sharing has become the norm of the day. Educational tools are trying to harness sharing as a potential tool to engage students in learning processes. But, does sharing lead to an improvement in academic performance? The present study investigates the role of instant sharing in the context of learning in a classroom setting. Two groups of students, from a suburban school in Mumbai, India, played an arithmetic game over a period of 7-8 months. The experimental group played on a platform that supported instant sharing, while the platform for the control group was standalone. All other aspects of both platforms were same. Analysis of process data of the two groups reveals that instant sharing increased engagement with the game. Students from control group lost interest in the game after some days, while experimental group students remained active on it till the end of the four-month period.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:07Z (GMT).

One approach for facilitating social interaction is small group collaboration. Successfully implementing small group collaboration in online courses, however, is not an easy task. In two iterations of a large online course, we first identified implementation problems and their possible causes (Course 1: N = 270), and subsequently tested possibilities of mitigation and corresponding improvements (Course 2: N = 111). The problems identified in Course 1 included a high dropout rate, low participation in group work, and low course satisfaction. These are typical problems in large online courses. However, their significance increases when they occur in the context of small group collaboration. Changes on the structural but also on the social level in Course 2 improved course satisfaction, but did not lower dropout rate nor did it increase participation in group work.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:11Z (GMT).

In this paper, we examine the outcome of two designs of the collaborative system with varying degrees of collaboration feedback. In the unstructured version, pairs are presented with no collaboration feedback while in the semistructured version of the system, pairs are given visual feedback in regards to their group and individual performance.  We collected log data of system use as well as audio recordings of pairs. We found that students in both conditions experienced significant learning gains. Shifts in dialogue initiative where significantly positively correlated to learning gains in both conditions. However, students provided with additional collaboration feedback, exhibited less planning and overall symmetry.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:12Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

However, investigations of students’ positive and negative interdependence during collaborative activities have often relied on self-report, rather than dialogue analysis. Bringing together politeness and social interdependence theory, we assessed dialogue indicators of positive and negative interdependence from behavioral data (namely, face-saving and face-threatening dialogue moves) and compared the results with those of self-report scales. We analyzed a data set of 30 elementary students learning fractions with an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). Our initial analyses focus on the link between use of language that is face-saving (e.g., marking identity with statements such as “we are great”) or face-threatening (e.g., insulting), and students’ preferences to collaborate and compete. We found only non-significant correlations between these two broad categories, but found significant correlations between dialogue indicators, such as the use of identity markers and joking, that suggest directions for subsequent studies.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:13Z (GMT).

The discussion in this paper serves as a first step in articulating how (1) CSCL tools can transgress and thus question official learning and working places and (2) how transgression can foster re-ordering of places and their practices.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:15Z (GMT).

Literature has revealed that learners had difficulties in collaborative argumentation on SSIs. The use of knowledge building pedagogies may be helpful for facilitating students’ collaborative argumentation. To examine the perspective above, this study attempted to integrate the KB pedagogies in collaborative argumentation regarding SSIs. In this study, learners’ collaborative learning behavior patterns in the context of online argumentation learning activities were explored. The participants were 48 university students from two classes and were randomly divided into experimental and control group (n=24 for both groups). The control group only received argumentation instruction, while the experimental group received explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation (CA) instruction (focusing on both argumentation instruction and collaboration nature of argumentation). Then, the two groups of students were asked to participate in KB-based argumentation for four weeks, in which the control group was provided with original KB-based openers in the KF while the experimental group was provided with CA-based openers additionally. Data was mainly from students’ online activities log files in KF. By analyzing the students’ knowledge building and collaborative argumentation behavioral patterns, this study found that these two groups of students revealed different collaborative learning behavior patterns. However, the students in the experimental group benefited more in both their knowledge building and collaborative argumentation from the proper adoption of knowledge building pedagogies and explicit idea-centered collaborative argumentation instruction in online SSI-based argumentation learning activities.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:16Z (GMT).

Each year students studied human body systems over a whole school year using Knowledge Forum (KF). Both classes worked with an idea-centered, principle-based framework of knowledge building; students in class B (year 2) particularly engaged in reflective structuration to co-construct structures of inquiry as their work unfolded. Qualitative analyses of rich classroom data elaborated the reflective structuration process in class B. The analyses of student online discourse showed that compared to class A in year 1, class B made more purposeful and sustained contributions to understanding various human body systems and developed more sophisticated explanations.","Made available in DSpace on 2017-06-19T08:59:17Z (GMT).
